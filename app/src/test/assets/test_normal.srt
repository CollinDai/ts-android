(Run time 02:05:14)

2
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,980
Okay.

3
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,455
Okay.
I know, I know.

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,635
I'm sorry,
I know it's a little tender.

5
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,106
Hmm...

6
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,266
Okay.
Let's try your voice now.

7
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,080
My name is Katniss Everdeen,
I'm from District 12.

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,243
My...

9
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,879
Okay, take your time.

10
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,949
You got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.

11
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:16,272
My...

12
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:18,594
name...

13
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:20,501
is...

14
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,697
Katniss

15
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:24,956
Everdeen.

16
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,576
I want...

17
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,148
I want to talk to him.

18
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,479
He needs time.

19
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:39,979
But...

20
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:42,350
We're trying something new today.

21
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:45,438
He's been calmer with
the doctors, but...

22
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:48,075
They are strangers to him,
so...

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,406
They're going to test his responses
someone he remembers from home.

24
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,838
Someone you trust.

25
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,881
Send her in.

26
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,153
Hey.

27
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:22,812
Hey.

28
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,770
- How're you doing?
- She's too close.

29
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,885
It's okay.

30
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:30,016
We're in District 13 now.

31
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,357
It's a real place.
The stories are true.

32
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,123
My family hasn't come to see me.

33
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,502
There's an attack on 12.

34
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,644
My family.

35
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,926
They didn't survive.

36
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,813
Because of Katniss.

37
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,727
- It's because of Katniss.
- It wasn't because of Katniss.

38
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:17,068
- She tell you to say that.
- She didn't tell me anything.

39
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,703
She's a liar, Prim.

40
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,361
It's the truth.

41
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:21,689
Yeah.

42
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:24,371
What you're saying isn't real.

43
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,821
She sent you here
to talk to me.

44
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:31,522
- She knows you're here now.
- It's okay.

45
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,674
She knows.
You can't trust her!

46
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,508
She's a monster!
She's a mutt!

47
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,577
The Capitol bring her
to destroy us!

48
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:38,645
Get her out of there.

49
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,045
Do you understand me!

50
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,906
You have to kill her, Prim!

51
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,082
You have...
to kill her!

52
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,597
- Katniss.
- She's a mutt!

53
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:50,578
- This is just the condition responds.
- Kill her!

54
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:53,119
- It's not him.
- She's a monster! She's a mutt!

55
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,335
- No, it's not him.
- She's a mutt!

56
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,714
Please, come in.

57
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,482
Will you excuse us?

58
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,555
- For just a moment.
- Of course.

59
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:11,777
Have a seat.

60
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm glad you're feeling better.

61
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:26,325
Snow has to pay
for what he's done.

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,217
I want to help the rebels
in any way I can.

63
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:29,767
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

64
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,568
That's not Peeta.

65
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:35,650
Send me to the Capitol.
I'll do anything.

66
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,091
I can't.

67
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,720
I can't send you there.

68
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,195
We can't get into the Capitol
until we control District 2.

69
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,222
Then send me to 2.

70
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,694
You want me to
fire up our troops.

71
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,785
Call out to the loyalists,
I'll see what I can do.

72
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,139
Yes, that'll help.

73
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,666
I saw Peeta

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,095
before we left.

75
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,165
What'd you think?

76
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,049
Something selfish.

77
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,609
That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore?

78
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,303
No.

79
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,087
I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.

80
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,143
You'll never let him go.

81
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,588
What's going on in your head?

82
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,615
I don't know.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,159
It's like kissing
someone who's drunk.

84
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:38,826
It doesn't count.

85
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,273
Prepare for landing.

86
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,850
Wrap it up.

87
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,048
Last chance.
Go.

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,172
This is another bird and food
trapping resource.

89
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,842
This one is designed to blind,

90
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,529
the smoke clings to the eyes.

91
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,859
That's an application for
Hummingbird trap.

92
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,102
You scared the people,
so they flee in this direction

93
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,344
to what they think is a safe haven.

94
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,746
Two tier explosion.

95
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,324
We'll have people enough time to
rush in and help the wounded.

96
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,353
A second bomb.

97
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,771
Right.

98
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,421
Second one goes off here.

99
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:21,728
I guess there are
no rules anymore

100
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,545
about what a person can do
to another person.

101
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:29,174
I don't think some of us use any
rule book when we hijacked Peeta.

102
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,250
Welcome to District 2.

103
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,510
I'm Corporal Homes.
If you'll follow me, please.

104
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,296
Don't worry.

105
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:05,585
That's how the loyals
say good morning.

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,477
President Coin, we're indebted
to you for the reinforcements

107
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,364
and the Mockingjay.

108
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,310
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2
knows what we've been up against.

109
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,849
This is the Nut.

110
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:19,411
The Capitol's headquarters
for our offensive operations.

111
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:23,948
It's manned by both military and
civilian personnel from District 2.

112
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:27,214
As you can see, the fortress
lies so far beneath the bedrock,

113
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,559
it's untouchable.

114
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,494
Yesterday, we attempted to take
the northeastern gate.

115
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,569
Then we encountered from higher up
and we're forced to pull back.

116
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,359
We took heavy loses.

117
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,191
Could we create a decoy?
Send troops towards one of the gates

118
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:42,143
and just send an attack on another.

119
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,449
Well, who's troops do you
propose as a decoy, Commander.

120
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,967
We have the Mockingjay,
don't underestimate her.

121
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:50,399
We could use her to erode support.

122
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,739
She maybe be able to sway
some of the loyalists.

123
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:56,297
You've been underground
a long time, Madam Coin.

124
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,594
This isn't like the rest of Panem

125
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,587
Support for the Capitol runs deep here.

126
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:03,819
Then there's no sacrifice is too great.

127
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:08,069
We need to control the arsenal
inside that fortress.

128
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:12,159
Even with every District and it's alliance,
we're outgunned.

129
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,286
I won't commit my people to a
ground assault,  just to pillage weapons.

130
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,851
Commander Paylor.
Your people,

131
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,591
have suffered more than just as
anyone else in the hands of the Capitol.

132
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,285
Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.

133
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,179
If we don't take District 2,
we won't get in to the Capitol.

134
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,862
We'll be enough to disable the fortress,

135
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,807
instead of taking it.

136
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,018
What do you have in mind?

137
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:33,688
We think of it like a wolf den.

138
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:36,440
You're not going to fight your way in,
so you got two choices.

139
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:39,353
You trap the wolves inside
or you flush them out.

140
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:40,834
We can't attack straight on.

141
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,922
Couldn't we use a hovercraft
to strike around it?

142
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,784
We use the mountains,
we have weak spots and peaks.

143
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,699
We could design the bomb to target
some sequence season seismic data.

144
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:48,935
Trigger avalanches.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,889
Block all exits,
cut off their supplies.

146
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:53,647
You make it impossible for them
to launch their hovercrafts.

147
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:55,335
Bury them alive.

148
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,585
We forfeit any chance
to control the weapons.

149
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,514
Yes, but we'd place
a weaken in Capitol.

150
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,366
There're civilians in there.

151
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:04,067
They should be given
a chance to surrender.

152
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,299
Use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees

153
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:09,226
That's a luxury we weren't given
when they fire-bombed 12.

154
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,965
There's got to be a better way.

155
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,449
I suggest we try the avalanche
but leave the train tunnel alone.

156
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,186
Civilians can escape into the square

157
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:19,257
where our armies will be
waiting for their surrender.

158
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:21,908
We should have every
available medic standing by.

159
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,862
And if they won't surrender?

160
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:28,819
Then we will need a compelling voice
to persuade them.

161
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,424
What's the difference, Katniss.

162
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:02,562
Crushing the enemy alive or blown them
out of the sky with one of Beetee's arrows,

163
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,190
it's the same thing.

164
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:07,226
We were under attack
in District 8.

165
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,604
And that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.

166
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,104
It doesn't matter.

167
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,860
You feel civilians are just mopping floors,
they're helping the enemy.

168
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:18,422
If they have to die,
I can live with that.

169
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,818
No one who supports
the Capitol is innocent.

170
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:23,164
What about the kind of thinking
you can kill whoever you want.

171
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,952
You can send kids off to the
Hunger games to keep the Districts in line.

172
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,088
It's war, Katniss.

173
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,180
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

174
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,753
Figure if anyone who knew that
it was you.

175
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,048
I, of all people
know that it's always personal.

176
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,933
Don't worry, Katniss.

177
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,900
There will be survivors.

178
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,278
Let's focus on what
it is you got to say.

179
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:27,137
- Now, Plutarch wrote a speech...
- I'm not saying that.

180
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:30,595
Okay, I didn't think so.
Just...

181
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,929
Just remember you're talking to everybody.

182
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:37,455
And not just the rebels,
but the Capitol and the survivors into

183
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,756
well, to lay down their arms.

184
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:44,160
So, you might want to experiment with
a little sensitivity when you warn them.

185
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:46,489
Make it quick, the explosion.

186
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,720
This is Katniss Everdeen,

187
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:15,678
speaking to all of the loyalist
from the heart of District 2.

188
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,878
Survivors.
Inbound!

189
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:19,346
Ready!
Ready!

190
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,490
Arms at ready, guns up!

191
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,144
We got to get you back.

192
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,038
Here they come!

193
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,944
Everybody, stand back!

194
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:38,266
Everybody, go!

195
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,302
- On the ground!
- Get them off the train!

196
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,669
Put your weapons down.

197
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:43,988
Get on the ground!

198
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:46,456
Put your weapons down, now!

199
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,755
Weapons down.

200
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,940
You, put it down.

201
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,984
Put it...
Put your weapons down!

202
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,744
Drop your weapon!

203
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,555
You, drop it!

204
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,827
Drop the gun!

205
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:02,207
Drop it!

206
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,130
- Hold your fire.
- Stop!

207
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:05,516
Stop!

208
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,427
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

209
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:08,547
Hold your fire!

210
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,926
- He needs help!
- Hold your fire!

211
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,870
Drop it.

212
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,939
Give me one reason
I shouldn't shoot you.

213
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:19,702
Drop the gun!

214
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:29,950
I can't.

215
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,073
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

216
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:39,401
We blew up your mine.

217
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,836
You burned my district to the ground.

218
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,864
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

219
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,914
So, if you want to kill me too.

220
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:53,704
Make someone happy.

221
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:58,045
I'm tired
of killing slaves for him.

222
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:01,139
I'm not a slave.

223
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,993
I am.

224
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:06,179
That's why I killed Cato...

225
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,043
and he killed Thresh...

226
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,586
and Thresh killed Clove.

227
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:17,402
It just goes around and around,
and who wins?

228
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,279
Always Snow.

229
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:25,210
I'm done being
a piece in his Game.

230
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:29,297
District 12, District 2
we have no fight.

231
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,325
Except the one the Capitol gave us.

232
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,421
Why are you fighting the rebels?

233
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,566
Your neighbors?

234
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,237
Your family?

235
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:06,489
These people are not your enemy!

236
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,986
We all have only one enemy.

237
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,266
And that's Snow.

238
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,285
He corrupts everyone and everything.

239
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,710
He turns the best of us
against each other.

240
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,863
Stop killing for him!

241
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:32,855
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

242
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,035
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

243
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,309
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

244
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:49,585
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

245
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,066
Hold you fire!

246
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:01,146
A toast.

247
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,728
Antonius.

248
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,514
With our best troops
crushed in the mountains

249
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,761
and the rebels marching
on us as we speak.

250
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:16,310
What do we celebrate?

251
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,930
The death of the Mockingjay, Sir.

252
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:23,659
If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

253
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,678
Of course.

254
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:44,630
That's the same facile thinking
that led you to divert

255
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:48,127
our best peacekeepers into District 2.

256
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:52,343
You have the habit of burying people
before they are dead.

257
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,560
If the Mockingjay was gone,

258
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:58,628
the rebels would already
be using her as a martyr.

259
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,284
No, Minister Antonius.

260
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,977
I'm afraid that is not what
we were toasting at all.

261
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,404
Yes, Sir.

262
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:10,778
The rebels can be held off out...

263
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:17,089
The rebels will reach the
outskirts of the Capitol

264
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,191
in a matter of days.

265
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,556
We'll evacuate the outer blocks...

266
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,953
to let them in.

267
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,699
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

268
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,752
so we're secured from the skies.

269
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,059
Lure them into the city

270
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:40,180
and then our gamemakers will make
them pay for every inch with blood.

271
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:42,928
I want every camera watching.

272
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,702
We will turn their advance
into a celebration of suffering.

273
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:53,237
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

274
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,548
So...

275
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:01,004
What do we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?

276
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:06,029
We toast to the glorious era

277
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,587
coming to it's bitter end.

278
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,620
Well, there she is.

279
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,645
The Mockingjay.

280
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,580
Oh, that itch you gave.

281
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:29,197
Oh, man, the feel. I mean
I still have goose bumps.

282
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:31,769
You don't mind, do you?

283
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,957
They cut off my supply of morphine.

284
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:36,678
This head doctor that comes in and
sees me everyday, she tried to...

285
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:40,111
help me adjust to reality
like some...

286
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:45,088
Like some guy from this rabbit warren
actually knows anything about my reality.

287
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,455
At least 20 times in a session
he tells me that I'm totally safe.

288
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,311
Safe from the Capitol.

289
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,467
Safe from Snow.

290
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,640
What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

291
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,179
Till I got shot.

292
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,630
Oh, please.
The bullet didn't even touched you.

293
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:12,340
Something they thought about.
Of course your costume would be bulletproof.

294
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,647
So, what are your injuries?

295
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:18,455
Bruised ribs.
Bruised lung.

296
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,286
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

297
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:24,186
Well, I got 2,
do you want one of mine?

298
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,118
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

299
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,910
Is that why you hate me?

300
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,026
Partly.

301
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,635
You're also a little
hard to swallow.

302
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,945
The whole tacky romance drama and
the defender-of-the-helpless act.

303
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,808
Even though it's not an act.

304
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,449
Which makes you even
more unbearable.

305
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:45,395
Feel free to take
any of this personally.

306
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,004
You should have been the Mockingjay,
nobody has to tell you what to say.

307
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,092
But nobody likes me.

308
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,837
You're free.

309
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Maybe here, but...

310
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,993
In the Capitol, you're the
only thing they're scared of.

311
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:07,891
It's just stuff my family brought.

312
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,719
This from Peeta?

313
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:23,205
Yep.

314
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:32,265
They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

315
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,825
We showed him footage of your
speech in 2 (District 2).

316
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,523
He had real memories of you.

317
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,575
That still doesn't mean
I am going in there.

318
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,422
He's strapped down.
He can't hurt you.

319
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,773
No, This is different.

320
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:45,045
Haymitch, I really
don't want to.

321
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,849
Well, it doesn't matter what you want.

322
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:51,433
It's for Peeta.
What's the harm in trying.

323
00:22:08,886 --> 00:22:10,808
I watched you die.

324
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,717
- You look terrible.
- You looked better.

325
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,870
You're not remotely nice
to say that to me now.

326
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:20,830
I was never the nice one,
you were.

327
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,169
When I saw you die,

328
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,081
I remembered something.

329
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:30,140
About the bread.

330
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,801
I remember,
 you in the rain.

331
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,719
And I burned it on purpose,

332
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,665
to give it to you.

333
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,700
I remember,
my mother hitting me.

334
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,127
I was supposed to
give it to the pig.

335
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,665
That was the first
I've eaten in days.

336
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:55,762
How I take a beating
like that for you?

337
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,832
Because you are kind...

338
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,167
and generous.

339
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:05,310
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you loved me?

340
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:08,248
They said that's why
Snow tortured you.

341
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:10,225
To hurt me.

342
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,913
Snow says everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

343
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:20,022
All I know is that I would have
saved myself a lot of suffering.

344
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:23,033
If I had just given
that bread to the pig.

345
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,618
I think the only thing left to say
is thank you.

346
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,633
I need to be in the Capitol.

347
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,306
No, you've done your job.

348
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,311
You've been very successful as the Mockingjay,
you've unified the Districts.

349
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:00,445
And now we want you to rest

350
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,904
and to heal.

351
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,361
The last the rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.

352
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:07,385
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

353
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,311
We will shoot more propos,
right here in 13.

354
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:11,580
Showing them that you're alive.

355
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,789
- I should be with the troops.
- It will be like being on the front line.

356
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:19,246
As far as the soldiers know,
you survived a bullet to the heart.

357
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,015
I think they will understand
why you're not with them.

358
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,204
When we win this war,
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

359
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:30,499
We'll need you for the ceremony.
You are very valuable to us.

360
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:36,860
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

361
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,878
From this day forward,

362
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,996
in sickness and in health,

363
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,055
for richer or poorer,

364
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,106
I promise to love and
cherish you each day.

365
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,437
I, Finnick Odair.

366
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:58,905
Take you, Annie Cresta as
my wife from this day forward,

367
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,705
together or apart,
we will always be united.

368
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,344
One life.

369
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,004
One purpose.

370
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,846
One destiny.

371
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,148
You may kiss the bride.

372
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:51,282
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

373
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,941
Would you tell him hi for me?

374
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:55,955
We're old friends, you know.

375
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,930
We had a joint in the
cells in the Capitol,

376
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:01,102
we're very familiar with
each other's screams.

377
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm going to kill Snow.

378
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,450
Nothing good is safe
while he's alive.

379
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,226
And I can't make
another speech about it.

380
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,013
No more cameras.

381
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,686
No more  propos.

382
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:21,366
No more games.

383
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:27,055
He needs to see my eyes
when I kill him.

384
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,498
Now you're talking.

385
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:40,908
Find a way to the Capitol when
everyone is looking the other way.

386
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,052
I heard the medics talking, they're
shipping supplies to the front line

387
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,817
from Hanger 2
around midnight, tonight.

388
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:52,272
Medicines, painkillers I was going to steal
something in mess hall but I guess I could...

389
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,871
just stay here
and cover for you.

390
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:00,683
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss,
even the president.

391
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,657
You just have to be
willing to sacrifice yourself.

392
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:15,662
Don't you want Snow
to see you dance?

393
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,043
It's her.

394
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,808
Hey.

395
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,686
- I thought you were in the hospital.
- I was.

396
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,100
Come on.

397
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,065
What is she doing?

398
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:50,242
Well, it's so frustrating
that she goes rogue.

399
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,801
This isn't just about a lesson,
it's insubordination.

400
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,800
Bring her on the
first hovercraft back.

401
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,972
Don't be ridiculous,
she can't come back now.

402
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,324
She's an epic.

403
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:06,258
In the front line,
surviving a gun shot wound...

404
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,366
I couldn't stage it better myself.

405
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,003
No.

406
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:16,651
She's going to stay
where she is.

407
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:23,131
And whatever she's doing,
we conceived it.

408
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,830
It was our plan all along.

409
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,714
Of course it was.

410
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,257
Mr. Heavensbee.

411
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,863
You are the gamemaker.

412
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,428
I want everyone to know
whatever game she's playing.

413
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:39,562
She's playing for us.

414
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,315
I'm commander Paylor of District 8.

415
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,013
I'm a soldier like
all of you, so...

416
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,483
Here's what I know.

417
00:31:56,508 --> 00:32:01,357
For the first time in our lifetimes,
we're standing together with 13 districts.

418
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,155
From what I see here,
we already made history.

419
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:12,112
But history didn't stop to celebrate.

420
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:15,768
And we are facing an enemy that will
not change and will never surrender.

421
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:20,169
President Snow has pulled back peacemakers
to fortify the center of the city.

422
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:22,791
He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.

423
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,358
The civilians will be
confused and desperate.

424
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:28,662
You are under orders
not to target them.

425
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,650
We are deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.

426
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:34,574
We'll show the Capitol people
who we are.

427
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:39,225
To slow our advance, President Snow
is building a minefield of traps.

428
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,995
And lethal devices called "Pods".

429
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,575
The sadistic inventions the gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths.

430
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,509
If our armies make it past
peacekeepers and other defenses,

431
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,898
we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion

432
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,762
Where we won't just
unlock his gates,

433
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:55,945
but unshackle all of Panem.

434
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,788
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

435
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,458
If we die...

436
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,437
Let it be for a cause
and not a spectacle.

437
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:10,298
If we succeed, let it be for all
of Panem and let it be forever.

438
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:13,488
Yes, you already made history.

439
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,852
But the future...

440
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:19,189
Our future starts tomorrow at dawn.

441
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:22,433
When we march together
into the Capitol.

442
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,912
Squad 451?

443
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,482
Looks like you got
your meals covered.

444
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,988
- I'm trying to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

445
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:55,597
We've been hunting
together all our lives.

446
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,329
I know when you're going
to go off on your own.

447
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:04,696
You're going to
leave me behind too?

448
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,927
As you fellow soldier,

449
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,607
I suggest that
you stay with your unit.

450
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,641
I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

451
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,335
Hawthorne.
Everdeen.

452
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:19,845
Come meet your new unit.

453
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,775
I'm Lieutenant Jackson.

454
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,236
And I want to introduce
you to your squad.

455
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:34,674
This is the second lieutenant Mitchell.
The best sharp shooter in Panem.

456
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,785
These are the Leeg sisters,
First Combat Division.

457
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,940
And this is Corporal Homes.

458
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,159
Finnick?

459
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,663
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

460
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,355
That's a short honeymoon.

461
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,253
Yeah.
Well...

462
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,581
I guess we got to have one
in the Capitol.

463
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,098
- After we take it.
- Gather around.

464
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,190
Squadron 451.

465
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:06,121
You’re my unit.

466
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,909
Lieutenant Jackson is my second in command.

467
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,985
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

468
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,070
But we are a non-combat unit,

469
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,736
so, we'll be following days behind
the front line troops.

470
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:20,295
You are to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

471
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,255
The Star squad.

472
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,270
It's been decided that you are most
effective when seen by the masses.

473
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:26,537
So, we're not going to fight?

474
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:27,958
You do whatever you
are ordered to do, soldier.

475
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:30,209
It's not your job
to ask question.

476
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:31,575
Yes, sir.

477
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:34,096
Our instructions are to shoot
propaganda footage

478
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,365
on the battle scars
troop to the Capitol.

479
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,760
You are handpicked to
intimidate their forces.

480
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:40,781
And inspire surrenders.

481
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,906
Even though we'll be working on abandon
streets miles behind the front line,

482
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,902
I guarantee you, wherever they put us,
it will not be sure.

483
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,850
This is a war zone.

484
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,155
It is likely that we'll encounter both
active Pods and peacekeepers.

485
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:56,925
You're considered high value
targets to the Capitol.

486
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,335
In the event of capture,
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

487
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,046
A poison that acts immediately.
Lieutenant Jackson do the honors.

488
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,272
I've already briefed
you on the Pods.

489
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,510
I remind you,
they are on every block.

490
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:12,744
Our unit has been given a HOLO.

491
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,430
A database that contain the
detailed map of the Capitol

492
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:19,353
and the list of every known Pod.

493
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,811
These Pods,

494
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:24,619
can trigger anything from bombs,
to traps, to mutts.

495
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,664
We cannot move without this device.

496
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:28,769
There's no guarantee that
our database is complete.

497
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:30,728
There can be new Pods
that we are not aware of.

498
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:33,830
Because we don't want the gamemakers
to know we have this Intel.

499
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:36,759
There's a self-destruct on it
You flip this switch.

500
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:40,942
You say, "nightlock" 3 times it's going to blow
itself and anything within a 10 foot radius.

501
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,745
Stay within our unit.

502
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,891
Even with the HOLO, it's likely
that new Pods have been set.

503
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,966
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

504
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,015
Ladies and gentlemen.

505
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,383
Welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

506
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,440
I've never seen this place so empty.

507
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:29,586
Just keep your eyes open.

508
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:52,851
We got a Pod..

509
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,682
Stay cover.

510
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,330
Shoot through those 2 buildings.

511
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,098
Pod.

512
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,624
Right here.
Cressida.

513
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,018
Good.

514
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:24,366
When you're ready, Katniss.

515
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:33,226
Hold it.
Pod is tighter.

516
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,641
Okay.

517
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:07,534
All clear.

518
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,679
I don't think we can
get across this minefield.

519
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:14,736
Not without that HOLO.

520
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,471
We're not getting to get it
off him while he's awake

521
00:39:17,496 --> 00:39:20,000
Make sure we're on the
same watch tonight.

522
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,601
Is that peacemakers?

523
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,261
451 to Base. We got a truck
coming in from the south, over.

524
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,655
Copy that, over.

525
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,548
Stand down everyone, it's friendly.

526
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,342
I'm with District 12.

527
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,238
I'm with District 12.

528
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,643
Okay, stop.

529
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,935
Hold up.
Everyone relax.

530
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,629
What are we doing?

531
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,612
Jackson, cuff him.

532
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:53,160
Soldier, this is just a precaution, until we
have everything straighten out, yeah.

533
00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:57,998
I'm District 12.

534
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,348
They want us to
add him to the propo.

535
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,581
To show he's on our side now.

536
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:08,335
We'll move forward a few blocks
tomorrow and shoot him a footage.

537
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,932
He's not in control of himself.

538
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,926
I say we schedule an around
the clock watch on him.

539
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:14,557
The Leegs till 1700.

540
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,978
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

541
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:18,945
Give me a watch.

542
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:22,800
If it ever came down to it,
you think you can shoot him?

543
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:27,095
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

544
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,259
I'm not sure that kind of comment
recommends you for the job either, soldier.

545
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:33,616
Put her in the rotation.

546
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,723
He's going to try to kill me.

547
00:41:57,897 --> 00:42:00,821
Especially with all this going on.
It's going to set him off.

548
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,242
We'll keep him contained.

549
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:05,514
Why would Coin do this?

550
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:11,342
Here's all I know.

551
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,437
It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

552
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:16,930
She never liked you.

553
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:20,026
She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.

554
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:24,154
- So, she would put my life in danger?
- She denied, but...

555
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:25,779
What?

556
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:28,680
One way or another this war
is going to come to an end.

557
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,605
They promised a free election.

558
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,723
Maybe she's starting
to see you as a threat.

559
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,855
Nobody would
think that I'd be a leader.

560
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,407
But you'll throw support to someone,
would it be her?

561
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:47,577
If your immediate answer isn't yes,
then you are dangerous.

562
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,711
She doesn't need you as a rallying cry any more
than these propos can be done without you.

563
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,703
Only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion.

564
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,452
Die.

565
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:01,285
That's not going to happen
under my watch, Katniss.

566
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,219
I'm planning for you
to have a long life.

567
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,798
Why?
You don't owe me anything.

568
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:11,274
Because you've earned it.

569
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,908
We've been here before, you know?

570
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:27,604
What?

571
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:30,183
That look.

572
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,892
I've seen that look.

573
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,534
You're trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me.

574
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,747
I never wanted to kill you.

575
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:45,348
That's not what I'm doing.

576
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,610
I saw with my own eyes.

577
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,285
In the first games

578
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,206
In the first games, I thought you were
trying to help the Careers to kill me.

579
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:57,408
After that, I saw you...

580
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,886
as an ally.

581
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,015
Friend.

582
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,882
Lover

583
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,061
Victor.

584
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:10,635
Fiancee.

585
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,860
Enemy

586
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,156
Target.

587
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:16,146
Mutt.
And now ally?

588
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:19,893
Yeah. I'll add it to the list of words
I use to try to figure you out.

589
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,380
I'm sorry.

590
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:33,137
I just can't tell what's real
and what's made up anymore.

591
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:36,987
Then ask.
That's what Annie does.

592
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:38,442
Ask who?

593
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,762
Us.
We're your new unit now.

594
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,334
Your favorite color is green.

595
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,045
Is that's real?

596
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:02,001
Yeah.
It's green.

597
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,249
Yours is orange.

598
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,276
Not... bright orange.

599
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:13,793
Soft like the sunset.

600
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,291
Thank you.

601
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,275
You're a painter.

602
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,587
You're a baker.

603
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,874
You always sleep
with the windows open.

604
00:45:34,486 --> 00:45:37,033
You never take sugar in your tea.

605
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,419
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

606
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,652
You were right.

607
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:49,861
I can't do this.

608
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:01,918
I guess we're not leaving anymore.

609
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:06,422
We're not going anywhere
without that HOLO.

610
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:09,187
Listen up.

611
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,705
The mag's empty.

612
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:17,650
It's for someone for the propo.

613
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:25,353
Let's move.
We're heading 5 blocks north.

614
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:41,732
To the Citizens in the Capitol.
Our war is not with you.

615
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,947
To the Citizens in the Capitol.
Our war is not with you.

616
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,521
You will be a vital part of the
democracy that follows our victory.

617
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:53,874
Be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory.

618
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,306
- You got it.
- Okay.

619
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,095
Boggs.

620
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,317
This is a good spot.

621
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:22,549
- Through there, in the courtyard.
- Okay, let us clear it.

622
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,668
Got a Pod.

623
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,308
Split.
Take cover

624
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,230
Stay back.

625
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,336
All clear.
Gale, Homes, with me.

626
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:30,216
Leegs, take the wings.

627
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,128
Everdeen, no!

628
00:48:57,153 --> 00:48:59,388
- Boggs!
- Hold your position.

629
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:01,091
Boggs!

630
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:05,775
It's okay.

631
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,626
The HOLO.
The HOLO.

632
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:12,540
Unfit for command.

633
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,025
Transfer prime security clearance.

634
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,138
- Say your name.
- Katniss Everdeen.

635
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,408
- What did you just do?
- Katniss.

636
00:49:21,786 --> 00:49:23,610
Don't trust them.

637
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,105
Kill Peeta if you have to.

638
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,086
Do what you came to do.

639
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:30,723
Boggs?

640
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:45,321
Come on.
Come on.

641
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,815
He's gone.
He's gone.

642
00:50:18,176 --> 00:50:21,611
Go! Go! Go!
Now! Now!

643
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,845
- This way.
- Keep moving!

644
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:26,299
Katniss, go!
Come on!

645
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:29,706
Get to higher ground.
Now!

646
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:36,919
Finnick!

647
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,441
Peeta!

648
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:43,061
- Let's go!
- Oh God!

649
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:44,182
Come on.
Come on.

650
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,815
.

651
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,320
Come on.
Don't stop, let's go!

652
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,363
Come on! Come on!
We got to move!

653
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:52,057
Get inside.

654
00:50:52,991 --> 00:50:54,825
Everybody inside!
Go!

655
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,431
Go!

656
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:58,475
- Hurry up!
- Move!

657
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,656
- Go! Go!
- Move!

658
00:51:08,419 --> 00:51:10,065
Keep moving.

659
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,681
Keep moving to the top.

660
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,590
Go!

661
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,849
Hey. Hey.
I got you. Shh...

662
00:51:35,116 --> 00:51:37,078
It's slowing down.

663
00:51:51,912 --> 00:51:55,046
Gamemakers are still running
on the show.

664
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:58,725
- 451 to Base, over.
- Hey, we better move.

665
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,695
The peacemakers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

666
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,095
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

667
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,565
451 to Base, come in.

668
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,338
This is a bad spot.
We need to move, now.

669
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,681
451 to Base, over.

670
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:15,479
I can't get a signal.

671
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,356
But I can get us back to Base.
Everdeen, give me the HOLO

672
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,191
Everdeen, what'd I just say?
The HOLO, come on, let's go.

673
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:26,234
Boggs gave it to me.

674
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,155
- What are you talking about?
- He did.

675
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,451
He transferred security clearance to her.

676
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:32,943
I saw him.

677
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,544
And why did he do that?

678
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,745
I'm on special orders from Coin.

679
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,536
To do what?

680
00:52:41,687 --> 00:52:44,234
To assassinate President Snow.

681
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,800
I don't believe that
for one second.

682
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,945
As your new unit commander,

683
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,900
I order you to transfer
security clearance to me. Now

684
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,779
I can't do that.

685
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,971
Let's not lose our heads here.

686
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:12,503
I'm not asking it again, Everdeen.
Give me that HOLO.

687
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:18,305
She's telling the truth.
Plutarch wants it televised.

688
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,241
He thinks if we can film
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

689
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:25,174
It will make the Capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high.

690
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,959
While we're arguing, there's a hundred
peacekeepers on their way here.

691
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:35,570
Boggs promised me that when the
time came you would help me.

692
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,162
Alright, soldier.

693
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:56,378
The HOLO is yours.

694
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,237
I don't think we're going to leave
any footprints. We should move, now.

695
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:12,552
Most cameras outside should be
covered up by the oil.

696
00:54:12,577 --> 00:54:16,222
She can't move forward like this.
Her leg's too bad.

697
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:18,301
We have to evacuate her.

698
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,911
I'm sorry.

699
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,636
I'll stay with her.

700
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,310
As soon as we make contact,

701
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:28,109
we will send somebody back.
I promise you.

702
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,070
Alright, everybody, move out.

703
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:33,816
- Let's get him up.
- Go.

704
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,470
Can you walk?

705
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:13,864
(Barb wire cables and net.)

706
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,120
Come on this way.

707
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,567
Get these curtains closed.

708
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,036
It's the Leegs.

<font color="#ff8080">ATTENTION ALL PANEM RESIDENTS</font>

710
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:39,961
Good afternoon,
I'm Caesar Flickerman.

711
00:56:39,993 --> 00:56:44,571
Hear about continuing coverage
of the defense of the Capitol.

712
00:56:44,603 --> 00:56:49,498
Today, as our peacekeepers
valiantly hold off the rebels,

713
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:53,192
our story takes a surprising twist.

714
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:56,601
Katniss Everdeen.
Our once favourite daughter,

715
00:56:56,626 --> 00:57:00,205
has infiltrated the city
with some of the Victors.

716
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,522
Who's names are all too familiar.

717
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:06,255
Finnick Odair
and Peeta Mellark.

718
00:57:08,277 --> 00:57:12,312
Clearly, some alliances don't last forever.

719
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:16,475
Take a look at what happened
just a moment ago.

720
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,649
When our peacekeepers
cornered Katniss Everdeen

721
00:57:19,674 --> 00:57:22,575
and her band of foolish rebels.

722
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,988
Whatever arrogance brought this
treacherous girl back to us.

723
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:30,697
You're about to witness a great
victory, not only to the Capitol,

724
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:32,694
but for Panem.

725
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,796
So, there you have it.

726
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,628
Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.

727
00:57:57,653 --> 00:58:00,685
The girl who inspired so much violence.

728
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,761
Seems to have met
a violent end herself.

729
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:09,176
Stay tuned for more information.
Caesar Flickerman, thank you.

730
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,290
So, now that we are dead,
what are we going to do?

731
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,267
Isn't it obvious?

732
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,896
The next move is to kill me.

733
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,357
I murdered one of
our squad members.

734
00:58:27,186 --> 00:58:29,173
Katniss is right.

735
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:32,739
I'm a mutt.

736
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,166
It's only a matter of time
before I snapped again.

737
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:40,952
I'm not in control.

738
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:43,572
I need a nightlock pill.

739
00:58:43,597 --> 00:58:45,471
So, I can die when I need to.

740
00:58:45,496 --> 00:58:48,227
When it gets to that point
I'll kill you myself.

741
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,935
I don't think I ever really
understood the Capitol until now.

742
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:20,984

00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,457
So, Katniss Everdeen.

750
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:52,165
A poor unstable girl was nothing but
a small talent with a bow and arrow,

751
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,868
is dead.

752
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:57,488
Not a thinker.
Not a leader.

753
00:59:57,513 --> 01:00:00,735
Simply a face
plucked for the masses.

754
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,139
Was she valuable?
She was extremely valuable to you rebellion.

755
01:00:06,164 --> 01:00:10,741
Because you have no vision,
no true leader among you.

756
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:13,855
You call themselves an alliance,

757
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,255
but we saw what that means.

758
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,274
Your soldiers are at
each other's throats.

759
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,225
Good night. Panem

760
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,645
For those of you
who don't know me,

761
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,005
please allow me to introduce myself.

762
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,805
I am President Alma Coin,

763
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,905
leader of the rebellion.

764
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,475
I interrupted a broadcast
from your president

765
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,675
in which he attempted to defame
a brave young woman.

766
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,858
A face, picked for the masses,
he called her.

767
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:48,615
- Plucked.
- As if a leader...

768
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,955
A true leader,
could be anything else.

769
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,006
I had the privilege of knowing

770
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:58,895
a small town girl from
the scene in District 12,

771
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,635
who survived the Hunger Games
and the Quarter Quell.

772
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:08,727
And rose up and turn a nation
of slaves into an army.

773
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:14,315
Dead or alive. Katniss Everdeen
will remain the face of this revolution.

774
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,795
She will not have
died for nothing.

775
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,220
I have no idea
I meant so much to her.

776
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:22,995
Her vision and ours
will be realised.

777
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,177
A free Panem.

778
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:27,625
With self-determination for all.

779
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,765
And in her memory, we will all
find strength to rid Panem

780
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,851
of it's oppressors

781
01:01:36,046 --> 01:01:37,879
and be safe.

782
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:41,328
REMEMBER THE MOCKINGJAY

783
01:01:41,353 --> 01:01:44,548
- Snow is in his mansion.
- Where is that?

784
01:01:50,143 --> 01:01:51,785
That's us.

785
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,285
That's the city circle.

786
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,088
It's at least
70, 75 blocks north.

787
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,125
- 75 blocks?
- Uh huh.

788
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,865
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

789
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,849
These buildings, do these
look over Snow's garden?

790
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:08,565
- I...
- They do.

791
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,581
If he goes outside at all,
I can get a clear shot.

792
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:12,489
We are getting ahead
of ourselves here.

793
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:15,108
Whether they're looking for us
or not, we're pinned down.

794
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:18,134
Hit that button,
scan for Pods.

795
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:21,798
Just about every 10 steps.

796
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:24,545
Yeah, that doesn't even
show the new ones.

797
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,546
So, we can't go anywhere
in the streets.

798
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:29,048
And the red tops suggest to that.

799
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,280
There might be another way.

800
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:42,588
My brother knows these
tunnels really well.

801
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:46,155
He works sanitation down here.

802
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:48,720
I'm glad they made him an Avox.

803
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:00,624
Hey.
Hey.

804
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:03,493
You're going to be okay?
Look at me.

805
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:05,075
Look at me.

806
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:09,584
We're going to get through this,
I promise.

807
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:27,086
It take us 5 years to
buy his way out of here.

808
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:29,490
He didn't see the sun once.

809
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,368
We're too expose here.

810
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:38,719
Sir.
Shall I call you a doctor?

811
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,870
- What did you say?
- Shall I call your a doctor?

812
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:47,889
I hope you waking me for
something more urgent than

813
01:04:47,914 --> 01:04:49,436
an old man's health.

814
01:04:49,461 --> 01:04:52,869
They survived.
I don't know how.

815
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:54,795
We picked them up
on a surveillance cam.

816
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,718
Let me see.
I-I need to see for myself.

817
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:06,124
It's her.
It is her.

818
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:12,861
Her arena has moved underground.

819
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,685
Looks clear.

820
01:05:57,993 --> 01:05:59,854
Everybody, okay?

821
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,538
Yeah.

822
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,319
Alright, everybody.
Let's stop here for a bit

823
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:33,110
and get some rest, yeah?

824
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,779
I'll take first watch.

825
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,410
Hey, Peeta,
just step in there.

826
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,490
Alright, settle in, everybody.

827
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:17,566
Katniss, your watch.

828
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:47,293
You know, the capital, they used
tracker jacker venom on me.

829
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,526
That's what the doctors on 13 said.
You were stung once too.

830
01:07:54,893 --> 01:07:56,782
Real or not real?

831
01:07:58,304 --> 01:07:59,736
Real.

832
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:05,770
When they used the venom on me,
they would show me pictures of my life.

833
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:12,824
But some weren't real.
They changed them.

834
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,576
At first, they all-they all
blend together, but now...

835
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,845
now I can sort them out a little.

836
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:28,036
Like the... little ones that they changed,
they have this...

837
01:08:28,061 --> 01:08:30,451
this choir,
it's like they're

838
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:34,067
They are shiny,
they've been glossed over.

839
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,570
You should get some rest.

840
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:45,712
You're still trying to protect me,
real or not real?

841
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:47,116
Real.

842
01:08:48,613 --> 01:08:50,606
That's what you and I do.

843
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,830
Keep each other alive.

844
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:14,687
Katniss.

845
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,237
What is that?

846
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,922
We got to go.
We got to get out of here now.

847
01:10:24,947 --> 01:10:26,593
Mutts.
They release mutts.

848
01:10:26,618 --> 01:10:28,103
Pollux, what's is the fastest way out?

849
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:30,185
Come on, wake up.
Go!

850
01:13:08,727 --> 01:13:11,212
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

851
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,890
Pollux, lead us out of here!

852
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,066
Come on.

853
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:31,071
Jackson!

854
01:13:31,096 --> 01:13:32,866

855
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:40,485
Fall back!

856
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:43,152
Move.

857
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:47,635
Aw!

858
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,911

Move!

01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,801
Katniss.

860
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,540
GO!
Go, go, go...!

861
01:16:03,796 --> 01:16:05,857
Go, go, go!

862
01:16:12,946 --> 01:16:14,696
Katniss!

863
01:16:47,577 --> 01:16:49,780
- Aww!
- Finnick!

864
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,618
Finnick!

865
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,042
GAWWWWW !!!

866
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:58,009
- KATNISS !!
- Nightlock.

867
01:16:58,034 --> 01:16:59,846
- AAWWWW!!!
- Nightlock.

868
01:16:59,871 --> 01:17:01,514
Gwww!
EHHHH !!

869
01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:02,535
Nightlock.

870
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,721
AWWWW !!!

871
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:05,713
Come on. Come on!
Come on. Come on!

872
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:08,262
Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

873
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,358
Go!
Go!

874
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:26,769
Keep going.
Keep going!

875
01:17:59,223 --> 01:18:00,885
Peeta, come on.

876
01:18:01,129 --> 01:18:02,478
Peeta!

877
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:05,773
- Peeta, we have to get going!
- I'm a mutt!

878
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:07,061
- We have to get going.
- I can't hang on.

879
01:18:07,086 --> 01:18:08,496
- Yes, you can.
- Leave me. I'm a mutt!

880
01:18:08,521 --> 01:18:11,503
Look at me!
Look at me.

881
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:17,830
Stay with me.

882
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,124
Always.

883
01:18:20,282 --> 01:18:21,736
Come on.

884
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,318
I know where we are.

885
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:29,344
I know a place.
Up those stairs.

886
01:18:33,712 --> 01:18:35,456
Keep going.

887
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:48,681
WANTED
<font color="#ff8080">GALE HAWTHORNE</font>

888
01:18:51,514 --> 01:18:54,501
WANTED
<font color="#ff8080">PEETA MELLARK</font>

889
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:58,332
Someone's coming.

890
01:19:01,776 --> 01:19:03,889
Shut the door.
Shut the door.

891
01:19:04,376 --> 01:19:06,725
No, that isn't the way.
It's okay.

892
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,230
It's okay.

893
01:19:10,506 --> 01:19:14,910
Tigris, you remember me?
I'm with Plutarch's Underground.

894
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,545
We need your help.

895
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:18,118
Clear!

896
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,748
I know you.

897
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:48,200
You're a stylist in the Games.

898
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:54,804
Until Snow decided
I wasn't pretty enough anymore.

899
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,682
I'm here to kill him.

900
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,363
He's got to need stitches.

901
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:00,571
I made it up.

902
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:03,508
All of it.

903
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,816
There is no
special mission from Coin.

904
01:21:07,841 --> 01:21:10,354
It's only my plan.

905
01:21:12,156 --> 01:21:14,759
Everyone that's dead,
is dead because of me. I...

906
01:21:14,784 --> 01:21:16,483
 I lied

907
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,902
We know.
We all knew.

908
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,900
- Soldiers from 13 didn't...
- Do you...

909
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:26,115
Do you really believe that Jackson
thought you had orders from Coin?

910
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,884
She trusted Boggs, so he
clearly wanted you to go on.

911
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:36,360
I never meant for this to happen.

912
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:39,975
I failed them.

913
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:46,815
I killed-I killed them.
I killed Finnick.

914
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,827
I'm sorry, Pollux.

915
01:21:51,403 --> 01:21:53,161
So sorry.

916
01:21:53,402 --> 01:21:54,988
Glimmer.

917
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:56,942
Marvel.

918
01:21:57,297 --> 01:21:58,903
Mags.

919
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:01,477
Clove.

920
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,592
Wiress.

921
01:22:04,775 --> 01:22:06,329
Rue.

922
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,815
What do all those deaths mean?

923
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:16,510
They mean that our lives
were never ours.

924
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,715
There was no real life,
because we didn't have any choice.

925
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,730
Our lives, belong to Snow
and our deaths do too.

926
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:34,379
But if you kill him, Katniss.

927
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,582
If you end all of this...

928
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,427
All those deaths,
they mean something.

929
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,982
Salla.

930
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,822
Boggs.

931
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:49,664
Castor.

932
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:53,610
Jackson.
Finnick.

933
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,437
They chose this.

934
01:23:00,863 --> 01:23:02,623
They chose you.

935
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:11,363
You should keep this clean,
otherwise it will get infected.

936
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,110
You should cuff me.

937
01:23:17,028 --> 01:23:19,211
It's not safe with me yet.

938
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:22,156
I have moments when I'm here...

939
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,434
My memories are getting better,
but...

940
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,970
Other times, it's like I'm sleepwalking.

941
01:23:35,059 --> 01:23:36,819
You should cuff me.

942
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:02,423
Thanks, for the water.

943
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:10,787
I can't sleep.

944
01:24:10,997 --> 01:24:13,464
Yeah, I haven't slept
in days either.

945
01:24:20,452 --> 01:24:23,956
I should have volunteered to
take your place in the first Games.

946
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,811
Well, you couldn't.

947
01:24:27,928 --> 01:24:30,253
And she-she'd never have forgiven you.

948
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:33,747
You wanted you to be there and
take care of her family and you did.

949
01:24:34,132 --> 01:24:36,066
She can't lose you.

950
01:24:38,609 --> 01:24:40,493
She really loves you.

951
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:47,118
The way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.

952
01:24:47,143 --> 01:24:49,366
She never kissed me like that.

953
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,810
You know it's part of the show, Gale.

954
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,573
No, you won her over.

955
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,436
You gave up everything for her.

956
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,180
It's not going to be
an issue much longer.

957
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,073
I doubt all 3 of us are going
to make it out of this.

958
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:09,894
And if we do, then...

959
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,736
It's her problem who to choose, right?

960
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:15,201
Yeah.

961
01:25:15,232 --> 01:25:19,173
Well, I do know that Katniss will pick
whoever she can't survive without.

962
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:27,068
Mortar shells.
It's not ours.

963
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,760
Peacekeepers must shelling
the rebels outside the city.

964
01:25:30,785 --> 01:25:33,081
That's not outside the city.

965
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:41,549
Sun's coming up.

966
01:25:41,574 --> 01:25:44,314
There's some small arms fire.
Could be Paylor maybe Lyme.

967
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,981
The rebels are close.

968
01:25:46,006 --> 01:25:47,595
This is it.

969
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,025
[MANDATORY VIEWING]
<font color="#ff8080">ATTENTION ALL PANEM RESIDENTS</font>

970
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:03,065
To all Capitol citizens more than
half a mile outside the city circle.

971
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,935
I'm announcing a mandatory evacuation.

972
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,005
Come to the mansion.
I'm promising you shelter and sanctuary.

973
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:16,044
All refugees, come to my home

974
01:26:16,069 --> 01:26:18,908
There, you will be provided with food,

975
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:22,778
medicine, safety for your children.

976
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:27,771
And you will have my solemn oath
to protect you until my dying breath.

977
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:29,496
You should hurry up
with that last part.

978
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:34,013
Our enemies are not like us.
They do not share our values.

979
01:26:34,277 --> 01:26:38,519
They have never known
our comfort and our sophistication.

980
01:26:38,544 --> 01:26:41,975
And they despise us for it.
Make no mistake.

981
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,335
They are not coming
to liberate us.

982
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:49,022
They are coming to
destroy our way of life.

983
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,628
They are coming to bury us.

984
01:26:54,826 --> 01:26:57,196
Is he still in the mansion?

985
01:26:58,163 --> 01:26:59,413
Peeta?

986
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:02,277
Yeah.
I recognize the room.

987
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:05,160
Where's that?

988
01:27:05,983 --> 01:27:08,305
About 5 blocks away.

989
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:11,862
We are right here,
off the avenues.

990
01:27:11,887 --> 01:27:14,922
- The mansion is here
- What about the Pods?

991
01:27:14,947 --> 01:27:18,921
Well, they'd probably deactivate the
Pods around here for the resident safety.

992
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,703
That could work.

993
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,054
I can get close enough.

994
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:24,907
Every peacekeeper is
going to be waiting.

995
01:27:24,932 --> 01:27:27,688
Next to our faces
on every billboard.

996
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,610
Snow's offering shelter
to all the refugees.

997
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:37,733
Head straight north.

998
01:27:37,758 --> 01:27:39,669
There's going to be
thousands of refugees,

999
01:27:39,694 --> 01:27:42,701
just get into that stream
and don't look up.

1000
01:27:43,456 --> 01:27:45,219
We got one shot.

1001
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,013
Let's make it count.

1002
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,948
Good luck, Katniss.

1003
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:56,052
Thank you.

1004
01:27:58,176 --> 01:27:59,713
Pollux.

1005
01:27:59,997 --> 01:28:05,098
(Sign)* This is not goodbye,
I will see you later.

1006
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:15,101
Tigris, thank you for
everything you've done.

1007
01:28:15,507 --> 01:28:17,465
Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

1008
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:19,164
I can be a good distraction
that they know I'm...

1009
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:20,530
No, I'm not losing you again.

1010
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,825
You'll be safer with us.

1011
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:25,170
What if peacemakers are searching
the houses, and if he's captured...

1012
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,192
Then, give me a nightlock pill, okay.
I'm not going back.

1013
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,583
Stay alive.

1014
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,854
If I see you again, it's going
to be a different world.

1015
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,999
Alright, Katniss?

1016
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:24,822
Let's go.

1017
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,407
By order of President Snow,

1018
01:29:40,432 --> 01:29:44,325
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1019
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:49,765
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1020
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:56,332
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1021
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:59,091
By order of President Snow,

1022
01:29:59,116 --> 01:30:03,273
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1023
01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:08,715
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1024
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:15,473
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1025
01:30:16,151 --> 01:30:18,766
By order of President Snow,

1026
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:22,615
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1027
01:30:22,641 --> 01:30:27,939
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1028
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:34,704
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1029
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,458
It's the Rebels!

1030
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:12,891
Don't move!

1031
01:32:12,969 --> 01:32:14,566
Rebels!

1032
01:32:25,049 --> 01:32:29,261
Mama!
Mama!

1033
01:32:29,386 --> 01:32:30,750
Come on!

1034
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,371
Come on.

1035
01:33:26,702 --> 01:33:28,309
Shoot me!

1036
01:33:29,501 --> 01:33:31,340
Shoot me!

1037
01:34:18,704 --> 01:34:22,775
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1038
01:34:23,134 --> 01:34:26,420
The gates will open momentarily.

1039
01:34:26,445 --> 01:34:30,110
The children will be received first.

1040
01:34:31,683 --> 01:34:36,115
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1041
01:34:36,349 --> 01:34:39,529
The gates will open momentarily.

1042
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:43,289
The children will be received first.

1043
01:34:44,183 --> 01:34:48,620
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1044
01:34:48,788 --> 01:34:52,135
The gates will open momentarily.

1045
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,926
The children will be received first.

1046
01:35:05,831 --> 01:35:07,898
It's the Capitol.

1047
01:36:07,786 --> 01:36:09,800
Medic!

1048
01:36:11,829 --> 01:36:13,569
Medic!

1049
01:36:14,746 --> 01:36:16,235
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1050
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,950
Medics coming in.

1051
01:36:17,975 --> 01:36:20,018
Bring a stretcher!

1052
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:25,851
Prim.

1053
01:36:26,034 --> 01:36:27,658
Primrose.

1054
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:30,466
Prim!

1055
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:13,107
Hey.
I need you to lie back.

1056
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:18,249
You're okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

1057
01:37:21,832 --> 01:37:26,790
The fight was over after that Capitol dropped
those bombs at the feet of the palace.

1058
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,362
The rebels walked right in.

1059
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:36,255
Don't, Katniss.
The only one's working.

1060
01:37:37,076 --> 01:37:39,279
Everybody felt it.

1061
01:37:40,406 --> 01:37:45,376
Peacemakers. Palace Guards.
They had kids in there too.

1062
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,966
It was...

1063
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:55,105
It was over after that.

1064
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,738
Mom.

1065
01:38:20,512 --> 01:38:23,445
I remember the first
time I brought you here.

1066
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,105
And here we are.

1067
01:38:29,123 --> 01:38:31,622
I've brought all your things.

1068
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,914
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

1069
01:40:08,059 --> 01:40:10,748
Sorry, ma'am.
I can't let you pass.

1070
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:12,524
Let her in.

1071
01:40:12,576 --> 01:40:14,431
On my authority.

1072
01:40:14,456 --> 01:40:17,290
She has a right to
anything behind that door.

1073
01:40:43,806 --> 01:40:46,029
That's a nice one.

1074
01:40:46,757 --> 01:40:49,409
The colors are lovely, of course,

1075
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,900
but nothing says perfection like white.

1076
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,706
I was hoping you'd
find your way here.

1077
01:40:57,886 --> 01:41:00,751
There are so many things
we should discuss.

1078
01:41:04,856 --> 01:41:08,915
But I have a feeling your
visit will be brief. So,

1079
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,079
first things first.

1080
01:41:18,857 --> 01:41:24,021
I wanted to tell you
how very sorry I am about your sister.

1081
01:41:24,763 --> 01:41:28,566
So wasteful, so unnecessary.

1082
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,165
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

1083
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:36,964
In fact, I was just about to issue an official
surrender when they released those parachutes.

1084
01:41:36,989 --> 01:41:39,565
You released those parachutes.

1085
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:41,905
You really think I gave the order?

1086
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:44,975
We both know
I'm not above killing children,

1087
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,480
but I'm not wasteful.

1088
01:41:47,505 --> 01:41:50,885
I take life for
specific reasons.

1089
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:55,415
And there was no reason for me to
destroy a pen full of Capitol children.

1090
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,268
None at all.

1091
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:07,918
I must concede it was a
masterful move on Coin's part.

1092
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:14,242
The idea that I was bombing our own
helpless children to hold back the Rebels.

1093
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:18,045
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

1094
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:22,630
There was no resistance left inside
the Capitol or the mansion.

1095
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:26,652
Did you know it aired live?

1096
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:32,725
There's a...
particular savvy in that, isn't there?

1097
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:40,275
I'm sure he wasn't gunning
for your sister, but...

1098
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:43,696
These things happen in war.

1099
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:50,728
My failure was being so slow
to grasp Coin's plan.

1100
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:54,675
She let the Capitol and the
districts destroy one another,

1101
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:59,869
and she step in to take power
over Thirteen, I see.

1102
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:02,917
But make no mistake.

1103
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:05,801
She intends to take
my place now.

1104
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:11,297
But, I've been watching you.

1105
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,984
And you watching me.

1106
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:18,295
I'm afraid we have both
been played for fools.

1107
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,449
I don't believe you

1108
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:27,021
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

1109
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:32,516
I thought we had agreed
never to lie to each other.

1110
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,784
President Coin ask for you.

1111
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,433
You never came to see me.

1112
01:43:57,730 --> 01:44:00,874
- I wanted to.
- Was it ours?

1113
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,513
The bomb?

1114
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:07,141
The delayed explosion.

1115
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:09,840
The trap.

1116
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:14,015
To draw more people in.

1117
01:44:16,862 --> 01:44:18,628
Is that you?

1118
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,520
I don't know.

1119
01:44:23,226 --> 01:44:25,327
All I know is,

1120
01:44:25,663 --> 01:44:28,858
I'm suppose to take
care of your family.

1121
01:44:33,153 --> 01:44:35,295
And I'm sorry I couldn't.

1122
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:42,476
You can't protect
anyone in an Arena.

1123
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:00,931
Goodbye, Gale.

1124
01:45:17,986 --> 01:45:19,261
What's this?

1125
01:45:19,286 --> 01:45:22,504
The remaining Victors.
Won't you join us?

1126
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:37,416
I've invited you all here for
several reasons, but first...

1127
01:45:37,441 --> 01:45:38,709
I have an announcement.

1128
01:45:38,734 --> 01:45:41,011
I am taking the burden

1129
01:45:41,036 --> 01:45:46,034
and the honor of declaring
myself interim President of Panem.

1130
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:49,106
Interim?

1131
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:52,225
Exactly how long
is that interim?

1132
01:45:52,249 --> 01:45:55,057
We have no way
of knowing for certain.

1133
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:57,829
But, it's clear that people
are far too emotional

1134
01:45:57,854 --> 01:46:00,435
right now to make a
rational decision.

1135
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:03,230
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

1136
01:46:03,255 --> 01:46:08,433
But I've called you here
for a far more important vote.

1137
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,675
A symbolic vote.

1138
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:14,683
This afternoon we will execute Snow.

1139
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,186
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

1140
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:23,385
Capitol officials, peacekeepers,
torturers, gamemakers.

1141
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:25,151
But the danger is,
once we begin

1142
01:46:25,176 --> 01:46:28,488
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

1143
01:46:28,513 --> 01:46:32,889
Thirst for blood is a
difficult urge to satisfy.

1144
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:38,305
So...
I offer an alternative plan.

1145
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:42,101
A majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.

1146
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:44,845
The proposal is this.

1147
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:50,236
In lieu of these
barbaric executions,

1148
01:46:50,261 --> 01:46:54,810
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

1149
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:09,475
You want to have another Hunger Games
with the Capitol's children?

1150
01:47:09,942 --> 01:47:13,145
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

1151
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,832
Is this Plutarch's idea?

1152
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:18,749
It was mine.

1153
01:47:19,259 --> 01:47:25,869
It balances the need for revenge
with the least loss of human life.

1154
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:29,365
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1155
01:47:29,644 --> 01:47:31,421
No, obviously not.
This is crazy.

1156
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:34,466
No, I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

1157
01:47:34,491 --> 01:47:35,625
I say, yes.

1158
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:38,186
So do I.
Let them have a taste of it.

1159
01:47:38,211 --> 01:47:41,635
You guys, this way of thinking is
what started these uprisings.

1160
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:45,005
I vote no, with Peeta.

1161
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:46,731
So would Finnick,
if he were here.

1162
01:47:46,756 --> 01:47:49,335
No, he's not,
because Snow killed him.

1163
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,827
No.

1164
01:47:52,046 --> 01:47:55,118
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

1165
01:47:56,689 --> 01:47:59,076
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

1166
01:48:04,923 --> 01:48:06,995
I get to kill Snow.

1167
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,333
I expected no less of you.

1168
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,285
Then I vote yes...

1169
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,716
for Prim.

1170
01:48:23,953 --> 01:48:25,581
Haymitch.

1171
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:39,277
I'm with the Mockingjay.

1172
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:44,025
That carries the vote.
Excellent.

1173
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:47,951
I'll announce the games tonight,
after the execution.

1174
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:54,185
Bound to be
quite the show.

1175
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:01,704
Oh, you look lovely, isn't she?

1176
01:49:03,183 --> 01:49:04,928
So beautiful.

1177
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:08,945
Finishing touches.

1178
01:50:31,606 --> 01:50:35,859
Welcome to the new Panem.

1179
01:50:36,503 --> 01:50:40,670
Today, on the avenue of the tributes.

1180
01:50:40,695 --> 01:50:44,985
All of Panem,
a free Panem

1181
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:48,904
will watch more than
a mere spectacle.

1182
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:56,142
We are gathered to witness
a historic moment of justice.

1183
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:00,865
Today, the greatest friend of the revolution,

1184
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:05,778
will fire the shot
to end all wars.

1185
01:51:06,377 --> 01:51:11,038
May her powers signify
the end of tyranny

1186
01:51:11,063 --> 01:51:16,183
and the beginning
of a new era.

1187
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:29,658
Mockingjay, may your aim be
as true as your heart is pure.

1188
01:52:12,403 --> 01:52:16,258
Eh-ha-ha...
Ha ha ha...

1189
01:52:19,082 --> 01:52:20,312
No.

1190
01:52:20,337 --> 01:52:23,593
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

1191
01:52:23,664 --> 01:52:27,200
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

1192
01:52:28,289 --> 01:52:29,916
Kill him!

1193
01:52:31,565 --> 01:52:33,312
Kill him!

1194
01:53:44,513 --> 01:53:50,166
I'll say this for you, Katniss.
You don't disappoint.

1195
01:53:51,736 --> 01:53:55,159
Well, Plutarch gave
me a letter for you.

1196
01:53:55,184 --> 01:53:56,835
I don't want it.

1197
01:53:57,186 --> 01:53:59,627
You never make it easy, do you?

1198
01:54:00,993 --> 01:54:04,412
Okay.
I'll read it for you.

1199
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:09,382
Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

1200
01:54:09,407 --> 01:54:11,595
but once again
I was not.

1201
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:14,768
You're exactly what
I believe you were.

1202
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:18,865
I wish I could give you a proper good bye
but with both Coin and Snow dead,

1203
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:23,997
the fate of the country will be decided
tonight and I can't be seen at your side.

1204
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:28,305
Tonight, the 12 district leaders
will call for a free election.

1205
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:33,045
There's no doubt that Paylor will carry,
she's become the voice of reason.

1206
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:36,474
I'm sorry so much
burden fell on you.

1207
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,966
I know you'll never escape it.

1208
01:54:39,499 --> 01:54:41,290
But if I had to put
you through it again

1209
01:54:41,315 --> 01:54:44,656
for this outcome.
I would.

1210
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:48,159
The war is over.

1211
01:54:48,184 --> 01:54:50,694
We're in that sweet period
where everyone agrees

1212
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:53,689
not to repeat the recent horrors.

1213
01:54:54,086 --> 01:54:56,559
Of course, we are
fickle stupid beings

1214
01:54:56,584 --> 01:55:00,780
with poor memories and a
great gift for self-destruction.

1215
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:05,446
Although who knows?
Maybe this time we'll learn.

1216
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:09,440
I've secured you a ride
out of the capital.

1217
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:11,371
It's better for you
to be out of sight.

1218
01:55:11,396 --> 01:55:15,481
But when the time is right,
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

1219
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:18,022
The country will find it's peace.

1220
01:55:18,047 --> 01:55:22,767
And I hope you can find yours.
Plutarch.

1221
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,964
What now?

1222
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:32,556
Home.
We go home.

1223
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:40,231
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

1224
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:49,728
It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.

1225
01:55:52,596 --> 01:55:55,106
Promise me you'll find it.

1226
01:55:56,045 --> 01:55:57,716
Find what?

1227
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,520
The life of a Victor.

1228
01:56:02,641 --> 01:56:05,575
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my girl.

1229
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,132
And you don't be a stranger.

1230
01:56:16,846 --> 01:56:19,617
- Take care of her.
- I will.

1231
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:52,670
She's gone.

1232
01:58:00,110 --> 01:58:01,716
Get out.

1233
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,674
Get out!

1234
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:09,024
Prim is gone!
Prim is gone!

1235
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:11,843
She's dead and
she's not coming back!

1236
01:58:11,868 --> 01:58:15,431
Get out!
Get out!

1237
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,016
Peeta.

1238
01:59:53,566 --> 01:59:54,972
Hey.

1239
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:58,260
You came home.

1240
01:59:59,233 --> 02:00:00,563
Yeah.

1241
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:10,265
I found these...
off by the edge of the forest.

1242
02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:15,526
It's Primrose.

1243
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,360
I'm so sorry.

1244
02:00:38,371 --> 02:00:40,353
You'll be happy to hear
that Katniss' mother

1245
02:00:40,378 --> 02:00:43,245
has been training new medical
units in the Capitol.

1246
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:45,669
Gale has been promoted
to a Captain in District 2

1247
02:00:45,694 --> 02:00:47,985
to help keep order and security.

1248
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:50,485
And I'm loving every moment
with my son.

1249
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:53,425
He reminds me everyday
of his father.

1250
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:56,995
We all suffer so much.
But we owe it to their memories

1251
02:00:57,020 --> 02:01:01,071
and to our children to do
our best with these lives.

1252
02:01:01,096 --> 02:01:04,389
I hope we both
find in some peace.

1253
02:01:04,414 --> 02:01:05,842
Annie.

1254
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:18,050
I solemnly swear
to the best of my ability

1255
02:01:18,075 --> 02:01:24,132
to preserve, protect and uphold
the rights of every citizen at Panem.

1256
02:01:24,201 --> 02:01:26,613
There's Plutarch,
brand know it all.

1257
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:30,287
What are their saying,
no one ever wins the games.

1258
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,470
You love me.

1259
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:55,039
Real or not real?

1260
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:58,640
Real.

1261
02:03:54,087 --> 02:03:56,480
Did you have a nightmare?

1262
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:00,375
I have nightmares too.

1263
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:08,798
Someday, I'll explain it to you.

1264
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:11,982
Why they came.

1265
02:04:12,549 --> 02:04:15,080
Why they won't ever go away.

1266
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:24,750
But I'll tell you
how I survived it.

1267
02:04:26,206 --> 02:04:28,840
I make a list in my head,

1268
02:04:29,015 --> 02:04:32,183
for all the good things
I've seen someone do.

1269
02:04:33,226 --> 02:04:36,306
Every little thing I can remember.

1270
02:04:39,112 --> 02:04:41,094
It's like a game.

1271
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:44,479
I do it over and over.

1272
02:04:45,950 --> 02:04:49,712
Get's a little tedious
after all these years, but...

1273
02:04:51,076 --> 02:04:54,094
There are much worse games to play.

1274
