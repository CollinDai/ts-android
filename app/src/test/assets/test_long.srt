1
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:45,633
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,633
You don't waste time, do you?

3
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,367
I try not to.

4
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,667
Well, you need help?

5
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,767
Sure.

6
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,234
Would you like to tell us...

7
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,633
what the hell that was all about?

8
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't like good-byes.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,367
Kind of the point of
a goodbye party, John.

10
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,667
Went to a certain amount
of trouble, you know?

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,900
Could've at least stayed
a few minutes, huh?

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,800
Eaten some of the food
we so feverishly prepared?

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,434
I apologize, Harry.

14
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,034
But why are you moving so quickly?

15
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,800
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,234
You got the history chair at Stanford.

17
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,367
I wish.

18
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,434
Well, taquitos, chicken wings,

19
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,700
Roastie-toasties and beer.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,267
If we'd had more time,

21
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,301
We'd have done something
a little more grandiose.

22
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,067
Candlelight dinner at Mcdonald's.

23
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,667
Strippers.

24
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,468
Taquitos are fine.

25
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,434
A'right.

26
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:38,234
Art's gonna be along, too.

27
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:40,000
He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,934
Is George taking over for you?

29
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,600
George or Trimbell - Has
the Dean made up his mind?

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,700
He hasn't called.

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,767
My god!

32
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,201
Wh-What is this?

33
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,501
It looks like a Van Gogh,

34
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,733
But I've never seen it before.

35
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,401
Is that an original, John?

36
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:54,733
No, it's just a gift someone gave me.

37
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,067
Still, it's a superb copy.

38
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,667
Contemporaneous, I think,

39
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,600
May I take a closer look?

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,733
Please, yeah.

41
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:06,468
Yeah, it's the same
stretcher as Van Gogh used.

42
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,134
Yeah, there's writing
on the back in french.

43
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:11,568
Oh, "To my friend Jacque Borne."

44
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,834
Wonder who that was?

45
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,334
Someone he knew, I guess.

46
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,034
Brilliant deduction, sherlock.

47
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,934
Surely you'll have this
looked at, appraised?

48
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,967
Well, maybe sometime,

49
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:24,201
But I wouldn't really want money for it.

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,934
That does it.

51
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:29,800
Put that stuff in the kitchen.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,301
No, I'm gonna put it
in the bathroom, John.

53
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,568
Gas is off, electricity's on.

54
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,834
Get comfortable while you can.

55
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,967
The furniture's going this afternoon.

56
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,834
It's been years since I sat on a floor.

57
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,900
Heh. I can't remember her name.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,700
Eh, it's good for the back.

59
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,034
Can we do yoga exercises?

60
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,167
Tantric yoga, we can.

61
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,534
( Chuckles )

62
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,134
So you're leaving good old "We teach you"?

63
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,201
Rather suddenly, you must admit.

64
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,900
Truth time, John.

65
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,534
Is there a problem?

66
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,934
No.

67
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,401
Oh, come on, you know we wanna help.

68
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,301
That's appreciated,
but really--

69
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,568
There's no problem.

70
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:11,334
Well, now I am curious.

71
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,534
Where are you going?

72
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,534
Givin' up tenure...

73
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,534
a decade of professorship,

74
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:17,967
In line to chair the department,

75
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,800
And you don't know where you're going?

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,301
Call it cabin fever.

77
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,800
After a while, I get itchy feet.

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,134
I've done this before.

79
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:29,201
No, no, no, you're too young
to have done this before.

80
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,501
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.

81
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,067
Every woman on the faculty

82
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,633
Would give anything to have that secret.

83
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,234
Is that what they're after, Edith?

84
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,900
Oh, stop, Harry.

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,733
( Giggles )

86
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,301
Wow, can you pull this?

87
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,134
What the hell?

88
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,600
What do you hunt?

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,934
Deer, mostly.

90
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:50,101
Around big bear.

91
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,501
With a bow and arrow?

92
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,267
Most people can't bag a deer

93
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,267
With a rifle and a telescopic sight.

94
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,034
Though, good eatin'.

95
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,468
The best wild game.

96
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,234
Lives naturally, eats naturally.

97
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,600
Well, it's beautiful.

98
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,700
( Motor hums )

99
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,434
Art.

100
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,800
Ah.

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,067
So, can I get an "a" for awesome?

102
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,134
Oh, my gosh.

103
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,134
( Chuckles )

104
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,600
That was fun.

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,367
Hey, John.

106
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,800
You know Linda. You
had her last semester.

107
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,201
Hi. Hey.

108
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,334
She's one of my victims
now. I'm taking her home.

109
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,000
She wanted to come by
and say hello goodbye.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,568
Is Art as tough as I hear?

111
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:28,900
Oh, archaeology's tough.

112
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,234
Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher.

113
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,900
Oh, that's very politic.

114
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,501
It's very true. Uh-huh.

115
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,000
Something for you to
read on the road, pal.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,900
<i>"Shadows of the cave:
parallels to early man."</i>

117
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,733
Author: M. Jenkins.

118
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,733
Publish or perish.

119
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,733
I'd rather read

120
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,800
Than write another one.

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,733
Thank you.

122
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,034
Hi.

123
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,700
Oh, everybody, this is Linda.

124
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,534
Linda, this is everybody.

125
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,101
Linda. Hi.

126
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,401
So.

127
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,900
Where you going, John,
like we give a damn?

128
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,101
We've already covered that.

129
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,600
John's got itchy feet.

130
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
There are over-the-counter
remedies for that, John.

131
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,334
( Laughs )

132
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,167
So there is a problem.

133
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,301
I just like to move on now and then.

135
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,667
It's a personal thing.

136
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,134
Well, not to pry.

137
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm sorry I don't
have more to offer you.

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,134
Got conversation, some
seats for your behinds,

139
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,201
And, uh...

140
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,468
Is he ducking out on us again?

141
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,600
...I do have this.

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,267
Oh ho ho! Johnny Walker Green!

143
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:49,034
( Laughs ) didn't even
know they made it in green.

144
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,534
What do they pay you?

145
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,501
Nothing is too good for my friends.

146
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:55,468
But I'm sorry-- We are
down to plastic cups now.

147
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,468
That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.

148
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,167
I will do the honors.

149
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, come to papa.

150
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,900
Ooh! Here, cups, cups.

151
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,967
There we go.

152
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,000
Step on in here.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,201
There ya go...

154
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,667
one for the birthday
boy-- Excuse me. Art?

155
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,834
No, not for me.

156
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,234
Oh, no, I don't drink.

157
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,134
( Laughs ) we're not
gonna card you, darling.

158
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,301
All right, here, join
the circle at least.

159
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, to long life and good fortune

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
To our esteemed friend

161
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,334
And colleague, John Oldman.

162
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,434
May he find undeserved bliss

163
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:27,667
Wherever he goes.

164
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,700
Here, here.

165
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,367
<i>Skael. Na zdorovye.</i>

166
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,468
One off the top, John.

167
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:39,301
Mm! Oh, that's good.

168
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,501
Excuse me.

169
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:46,101
John, we're all sorry to see you go.

170
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,201
Truly.

171
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,834
Okay. Now we're done with that,

172
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,834
What do we do for the
rest of the afternoon?

173
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,568
Anyone got a good topic?

174
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,434
Like this, maybe? Heh.

175
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,501
What is that?

176
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,234
It's a burin of a parrot beak.

177
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,733
Inclined chisel point...

178
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,900
probably early magdalenian.

179
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,167
May I see that? Sure.

180
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes indeed, that's what it is.

181
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,468
What's a burin?

182
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,134
A burin is a flint tool

183
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,733
For grooving wood and
bone, antlers especially,

184
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,267
To make spear and harpoon points.

185
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,267
Magdalenians weren't
noted for flint work,

186
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,034
So this is a very nice specimen.

187
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:30,534
Okay, what's a magdalenian?

188
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,000
A later Cro-magnon,

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,334
Without gettin' technical.

190
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:36,468
It's the final culture
of the upper paleolithic.

191
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,401
If stones could speak, eh, Art?

192
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:40,067
So where'd you get that, John?

193
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,633
Believe it or not, from
a thrift shop-- A quarter.

194
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,234
You lucky dog!

195
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,501
I gotta go digging
for this kind of stuff.

196
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:47,733
Can I, uh...?

197
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,767
Yeah.

198
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,301
Huh.

199
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,067
Maybe...

200
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,667
I'm glad you did this.

201
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,468
Did what? You mean come over?

202
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,234
Maybe?

203
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,501
Definitely.

204
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,800
Gee, thanks.

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,201
Well, so are we.

206
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,667
So are we.

207
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,800
We couldn't let you just run off.

208
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Thanks.

209
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,834
John, what is up, huh?

210
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,334
<i>Are you on america's most wanted?</i>

211
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,534
We won't turn you in.

212
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,900
Yeah, come on, out with it.

213
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
You're among friends.

214
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,167
Snoopy friends.

215
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,234
Forget it.

216
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,900
You are creating the mystery here.

217
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,201
Obviously, you have something
you'd like to say. Say it!

218
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,468
Well, maybe I...

219
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,834
ten, nine, eight, seven...

220
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:36,900
Harry, stop.

221
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,301
There is something I'm
tempted to tell you, I think.

222
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,900
I've never done this before,
and I wonder how it'll pan out.

223
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,733
( Harry chuckles )

224
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,367
I wonder if I could ask
you a silly question.

225
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,401
John, we're teachers.

226
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:53,334
We answer silly questions all the time.

227
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,468
Hey!

228
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,134
What if a man from the upper paleolithic

229
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,234
Survived until the present day?

230
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,767
What do you mean, survived?

231
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,134
Never died?

232
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,201
Yes. What would he be like?

233
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,767
Well, I know some guys.

234
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,733
You ever been to the ozarks?

235
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,401
It's an interesting idea.

236
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,900
What, are you working on
a science fiction story?

237
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,167
Say I am. What would he be like?

238
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,167
Pretty tired.

239
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,767
( Laughter )

240
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,167
Well, seriously,

241
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,167
As Art's book title suggests,

242
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,501
He might be like any of us.

243
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,834
Dan. A caveman?

244
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,468
Well, there's no anatomical difference

245
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:29,468
Between, say, a Cro-magnon and us.

246
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,967
Except that as a rule,
we've grown taller.

247
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,267
What's the selective
advantage of height?

248
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,000
Better to see predators
in tall grass, my dear.

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,334
Actually, tall and skinny

250
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:42,201
Radiates heat more
effectively in warmer climates.

251
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,534
And as for neanderthals,

252
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,234
I mean, we've all seen apish people.

253
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,468
That strain's still with us.

254
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,600
But he'd be a caveman.

255
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,667
No, he wouldn't.

256
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,700
John's hypothetical man

257
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,468
Would have lived
through 140 centuries...

258
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:53,900
yeah, roughly.

259
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,301
...and changed with every one of them.

260
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,667
I mean, assuming normal intelligence.

261
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,134
Well, we think men of
the upper paleolithic

262
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,967
Were as intelligent as we are.

263
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,834
They just didn't know as much.

264
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,800
John's man would have
learned as the race learned.

265
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,501
In fact, if he had an inquiring mind,

266
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:14,101
His knowledge might be astonishing.

267
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:16,667
If you do write that,
let me have a look at it.

268
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,633
I'm sure you'll make some
anthropological boners.

269
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,767
It's a deal.

270
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,568
What would keep him alive?

271
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,468
What does the biologist say?

272
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,167
Cigarettes.

273
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,000
And ice cream. ( Laughs )

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,134
All right, all right, I'll play.

275
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,834
All right, um, in science fiction terms,

276
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,501
I would say...

277
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:39,834
perfect regeneration
of the body's cells,

278
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,000
Especially in the vital organs.

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,867
Actually, the human
body appears designed

280
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,000
To live about 190 years.

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,834
Most of us just die of slow poisoning.

282
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,401
Maybe he did something right,

283
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,700
Something everybody else
in history had done wrong.

284
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,167
What, like eat the food,

285
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,167
Drink the water, and breathe the air?

286
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,434
Prior to modern times,

287
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,101
Those were pristine.

288
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,568
We've extended our lifespan
in a world that's, uh...

289
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,501
not fit to live in.

290
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,000
You know, it could happen.

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,301
The pancreas turns over
cells every 24 hours,

292
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,867
The stomach lining in three days,

293
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,534
The entire body in seven years,

294
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,134
But the process falters.

295
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,934
Waste accumulates, eventually
proves fatal to function.

296
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:22,600
Now if a quirk in his immune system

297
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,401
Led to perfect detox,

298
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:26,367
Perfect renewal, then yeah.

299
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,667
He could duck decay.

300
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,900
Mm, that's a secret
we'd all love to have.

301
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,867
Would you really want to do that?

302
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,834
Live 14,000 years?

303
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,633
Well, if I could stay
healthy and I didn't age,

304
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,834
I mean, why not?

305
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah. What a chance to learn.

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,900
Is anyone hungry?

307
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,767
You know, the more I think
about it, yeah, it's possible.

308
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,401
Anything is possible, right?

309
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:52,667
After all, one century's magic,
another century's science.

310
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,834
They thought Columbus
was a nut job, right?

311
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:55,967
Pasteur, Copernicus?

312
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,600
Aristarchus long before that.

313
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,767
Right.

314
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,167
I had a chance to sail with columbus,

315
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,401
Only I'm not the adventurous type.

316
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,867
I was pretty sure the earth was round,

317
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:09,401
But at that point, I still thought

318
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,934
He might fall off an edge someplace...

319
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,267
look around, John.

320
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,733
We just did.

321
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,067
I suppose there's a
joke in there somewhere,

322
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,401
But I don't get it.

323
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,034
There's nothing to get.

324
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,134
What are we talking about?

325
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,434
We were just talking about a caveman

326
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:36,934
Who survives until the present time.

327
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,800
As you said, what a chance to learn,

328
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,234
Once I learned to learn.

329
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:45,468
Did you start the whiskey
before we got here?

330
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,434
Pretend it's science fiction.

331
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,267
Figure it out.

332
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:56,767
Okay, a--( Laughs )--
Very old Cro-magnon

333
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,334
Living until the present.

334
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
( Grunts loudly )

335
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,967
Oh!

336
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:06,101
( Laughing )

337
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,234
What?

338
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,134
John just confided that
he's 14,000 years old.

339
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,767
Oh, John, you don't look a day over 900.

340
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,067
Okay, okay.

341
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,800
All right, spock, I'll
play your little game.

342
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,568
What do you want? What's the punch line?

343
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,201
Every ten years or so, when people start

344
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,967
To notice I don't age, I move on.

345
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:30,000
That's very good,
that's very quick, John.

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,401
I wanna read that
story when you're done.

347
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,967
You want more?

348
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,834
By all means. This is great.

349
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,867
All right, now...

350
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:37,934
( laughs )

351
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,568
So you think that you are a...

352
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,700
a, uh, Cro-magnon.

353
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,267
Well, I didn't learn it in school.

354
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,034
That's my best guess,

355
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:49,501
Based on archaeological data,
maps, anthropological research.

356
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,934
Since mesopotamia,

357
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:54,267
I've got the last...
4,000 years straight.

358
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,267
You're ahead of most
people, so please, go on.

359
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,867
Well, you know the background stuff,

360
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,367
So I'll make it brief.

361
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,834
In what I call my first lifetime,

362
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,568
I aged to about 35...

363
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,267
what you see.

364
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,401
I ended up leading my group.

365
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,301
They saw me as magical.

366
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,367
I didn't even have to fight for it.

367
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,234
Then fear came, and they chased me away.

368
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,800
They thought that I was

369
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,367
Stealing their lives away to stay young.

370
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,468
The prehistoric origin
of the vampire myth.

371
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,468
That is good!

372
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:24,534
First thousand years,

373
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,667
I didn't know up from sideways.

374
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,101
How do you know the
first thousand years?

375
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,700
An informed guess, based on what

376
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,201
I've learned in my memories.

377
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,267
Most people can scarcely
remember their childhood,

378
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,367
But you have memories of that time?

379
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,000
Like yours, selective.

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,367
You know, the high points,
the low points, traumas.

381
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,167
They stick in the mind forever.

382
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:47,067
Put down at 3 or 35,
you still feel a twinge.

383
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:50,900
Go on.

384
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,700
I kept getting chased
because I wouldn't die,

385
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,000
So I got the hang of
joining new groups I found.

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,767
I also got the idea of
periodically moving on.

387
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,434
We were semi-Nomadic, of course,

388
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,401
Following the weather
and the game we hunted.

389
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,434
The first 2,000 years were cold.

390
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:11,034
We learned it was warmer
at lower elevations.

391
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:14,267
Late glacial period, I assume.

392
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:16,267
What was the terrain like?

393
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:19,468
Mountainous.

394
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,334
Vast plains to the west.

395
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:25,468
West--Something you
learned in school.

396
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:28,134
Towards the setting sun.

397
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,301
I suspect I saw the british isles

398
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,800
From what is now the french coast.

399
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,501
Huge mountains...

400
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,234
on the other side of
an enormous deep valley

401
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,301
That was shadowed by the setting sun.

402
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:41,101
This is before they were separated

403
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,733
From the continent by rising
seas, as glaciers melted.

404
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,367
That happened?

405
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,501
Yes, the end of the pleistocene.

406
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,733
So far, what he says fits.

407
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,600
Oh, yeah, into any textbook.

408
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,667
And that's where I found it.

409
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,534
How can I have knowledgeable recall

410
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,401
If I didn't have knowledge?

411
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:00,468
It's all retrospective.

412
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,934
All I can do is
integrate my recollections

413
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,767
With modern findings.

414
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,434
Caveman, you gonna hit me
over the head with a club

415
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,401
And drag me into the bedroom?

416
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,767
You'd be more fun conscious.

417
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,767
Oh, John.

418
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,067
Let me get this straight.

419
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,167
We're not talking about reincarnation.

420
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,767
You're not saying that you remember

421
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,367
Whatever the hell it would be,

422
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,600
200 separate lifetimes, dying

423
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
And being born again and yada yada?

424
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,501
One lifetime.

425
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,034
Some lifetime.

426
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,401
Wow.

427
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:29,867
Maybe there is something
to this reincarnation thing.

428
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,201
You're supposed to come back

429
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,767
Again and again, learn and learn,

430
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,401
And somehow, John, you just managed

431
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,967
To bypass all the other bodies.

432
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,267
Well, what's the point?

433
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,167
What about oceans?

434
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,501
Didn't see them till much later.

435
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,834
So how would you know
an ocean from a lake?

436
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,733
Big waves--
Something else

437
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,967
I can only surmise in retrospect.

438
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,967
Were you curious about
where it all came from?

439
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,834
We would look up at the sky and wonder.

440
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,834
"There's gotta be
some big guys up there.

441
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,633
What else made all this down here?"

442
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,201
At first I thought

443
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,267
There was something
wrong with me--

444
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:08,401
Maybe I was a bad guy for not dying.

445
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,800
Then I began to wonder if I was cursed

446
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,134
Or perhaps blessed.

447
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,800
Then I thought maybe I had a mission.

448
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,468
Do you still think you do?

449
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,334
God works in mysterious ways.

450
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,733
I think I just happened.

451
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,234
( Phone ringing )

452
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,434
( Laughs )

453
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,434
Wow.

454
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:35,667
Hello?

455
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,301
Yes, ellie?

456
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:40,434
What's wrong?

457
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,633
Sandy?

458
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,700
Coming.

459
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah?

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,733
Do we have ellie's midterm here?

461
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,234
Yeah, sorry.

462
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,700
I picked it up with the periodicals.

463
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,067
Got it.

464
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,767
No, you're worried about your parents?

465
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:58,900
Don't--Don't
worry.

466
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,600
You passed, c+.

467
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Take care of yourself.

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,468
Good kid.

469
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,301
What does pre-Med need with history?

470
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,534
Got it.

471
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you.

472
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,501
Sorry, guys.

473
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,234
John, please continue.

474
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:16,468
Come on, I thought we
were done with that.

475
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,101
No! Let's go on with it.

476
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,534
It's interesting.

477
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,367
Besides, I think he's making
a certain amount of sense.

478
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,967
Like hegel-- Logic
from absurd premises.

479
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,367
That Van Gogh?

480
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,568
He gave it to me.

481
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:31,267
I was, uh, jacque bourne at the time,

482
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,267
A pig farmer.

483
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,733
A pig farmer?

484
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,167
( Laughing )

485
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,267
I like to work with my hands.

486
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,401
He would come out to the place, paint.

487
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,468
We talked about capturing nature in Art.

488
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:44,234
Turner, cezanne, pissarro.

489
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,767
Oh, the nolde landscapes.

490
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,534
Not in Van Gogh's time.

491
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:49,067
He would have loved them, though.

492
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,134
Yes.

493
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:51,867
Well, I don't understand

494
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,034
Why you can't remember
where you're from.

495
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,834
Geography hasn't changed.

496
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,568
I learned
that in--

497
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:58,867
Professor hensen's tepid lectures.

498
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,334
But you're right.

499
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,468
Where did you live when
you were five years old?

500
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:03,633
Little rock.

501
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,633
Your mother, she took you to the market?

502
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,967
Mm-hmm. What direction was it?

503
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,568
From your house.

504
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:09,767
I don't know.

505
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:10,767
How far?

506
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,667
Um, three blocks.

507
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,201
Were there any references

508
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:15,667
That stuck in your mind?

509
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,134
Well, there was a gas station

510
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:18,767
And a big field.

511
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,900
I was told I could never go there alone.

512
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,568
And if you went back there today,

513
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,101
Would it be the same?

514
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:27,468
No. I'm sure it's all
different and built up.

515
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,834
Thus the saying-- "You
can't go home again"

516
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,134
Because it isn't there anymore.

517
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,967
Picture it
on my scale--

518
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:36,267
I migrated through an endless flat space

519
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,733
Full of endless
new things--

520
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:43,568
Forests, mountains, tundra, canyons.

521
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:46,767
My memory sees what I saw then.

522
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,700
My eye sees freeways, urban sprawl,

523
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,767
Big macs under the eiffel tower.

524
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,468
Early on, the world
got bigger and bigger,

525
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:58,834
And then...

526
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,633
think what I've had to unlearn.

527
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,534
And now you're moving on.

528
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,234
As you've said, there's
talk of my not aging,

529
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:08,067
And when that happens, I move on.

530
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,633
Well, it might make sense
to set up your next identity,

531
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,934
Your next ten years, and
then just drop into it.

532
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,700
I've done that a few times,

533
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,468
Even passed as my own son.

534
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,401
"Oh, you're an engineer, too?

535
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,934
You're ben's son. He was a good man."

536
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,234
Saves trouble with
credentials and references.

537
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,234
On the other hand, I've
been busted a few times.

538
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,301
Spent a year in
jail, Belgium, 1862--

539
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:33,000
I won't
forget that--

540
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
For faking a government application.

541
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,934
When'd you come to america?

542
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:39,067
1890, right after Van Gogh's death,

543
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,134
With some french immigrants...

544
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:42,733
moving on.

545
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,568
An answer for every question.

546
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,367
Except one, John.

547
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,700
Why're you doing this?

548
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:56,700
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.

549
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,301
I...

550
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,401
wanted to say goodbye to you as me,

551
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,401
Not what you thought I was.

552
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,267
Well, since this isn't funny,

553
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:07,700
We think you might have a problem.

554
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,501
A very serious problem.

555
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,633
I've got boxes to move.

556
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,367
I'll give you a hand.

557
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:20,367
Wouldn't you have
some relic, an artifact

558
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,800
To remind you of your early life?

559
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,301
Like this, maybe?

560
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:25,700
Thrift shop.

561
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,800
Really.

562
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,468
If you lived 100... 1,000 years...

563
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,501
would you still have this?

564
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,633
What would cause you to keep it?

565
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,434
As a memento to your beginnings,

566
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:40,934
Even if you didn't have

567
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,468
The concept of beginnings?

568
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,067
It would be gone, lost.

569
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,301
No.

570
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:49,101
I don't have artifacts.

571
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,967
Keep that.

572
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,334
Interesting.

573
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,867
You could have lied about that.

574
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,234
Don't talk about me while I'm gone.

575
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,101
Is he serious?

576
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,900
If he is, I'm sorry to say he's...

577
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
oh, how could he have
concealed that for ten years?

578
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,934
Least he doesn't appear to be dangerous.

579
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,834
What are you doing?

580
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,834
Checkin' for a hidden mic.

581
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,201
<i>Candid camera.</i>

582
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:30,800
He's fabricating these wild stories.

583
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,934
I've never seen him acting like this.

584
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,101
Oh, it's crazy.

585
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:38,534
All right, all right,
as soon as you can, then.

586
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,767
I love you, you know.

587
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,568
I know.

588
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,101
Since my first week at the office.

589
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,167
And?

590
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:02,534
I care very much about you,

591
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:05,101
But now you know what
you'd be getting into.

592
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,034
Do you really think you're a caveman?

593
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,633
Do you?

594
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,934
Could you love me,

595
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:18,334
Or don't you believe in that anymore?

596
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,000
I've gotten over it too many times.

597
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,034
Fond of you...

598
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,733
certainly attracted to you.

599
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:32,067
That's it?

600
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,600
I can work with that.

601
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,267
If what I'm saying is true,

602
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:45,900
You and any children will age.

603
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,234
I won't.

604
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:49,201
And one day I'll leave.

605
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,167
You'll go back to your
May-December romances.

606
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,367
The simple fact is

607
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,367
That I can't give you forever.

608
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:58,767
How long's forever?

609
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,700
Who ever really has it?

610
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:10,134
My parents split up before I was born,

611
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,234
And then my mom's next marriage lasted

612
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,700
What, a whole three years?

613
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,633
Then there's death,
illness, acts of god...

614
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,800
no one knows how long they have.

615
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,234
Or how little.

616
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,034
I love you.

617
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,568
Take whatever you can get.

618
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,134
Like ten years?

619
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,800
Ah! Ha ha ha!

620
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
( Yells )

621
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Uhn!

622
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh.

623
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,067
Why did you do that?

624
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:54,700
I wanted to see how fast you
were. Check your reflexes.

625
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,867
I don't have eyes in
the back of my head,

626
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,334
I can't hear a flea walking,

627
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,434
I am not in any way superman.

628
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,867
Well, I'm a second-degree black belt.

629
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,700
Give it another thousand years.

630
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,367
Well. I got it, I got it, I got it.

631
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:10,967
Jesus.

632
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,834
Smooth demonstration, Harry.

633
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,867
Sit on it, Dan.

634
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,633
I still have questions.

635
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,468
I-I do too, John.

636
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:22,234
I mean, are we done with prehistory yet?

637
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,667
Remember any of your original language?

638
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,867
A little. One thing
hasn't changed much...

639
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,267
( wolf whistles )

640
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:33,501
Did you ever do any cave Art?

641
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,534
Do you know the rock Art at les eyzies?

642
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,733
Mm-hmm.

643
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,067
It was the work of a man named...

644
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,700
giraud.

645
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,501
He did a pretty good job.

646
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,000
He would draw the animals

647
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,267
That we hoped to find to eat.

648
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:50,501
One day after a fruitless hunt,

649
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,367
Our chief stomped his teeth out

650
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,568
Because his magic had failed him.

651
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,633
After that, someone had
to chew his food for him.

652
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,468
Finally, he
got-- I suspect--

653
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,600
An infected jaw,

654
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,267
And he was abandoned.

655
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,101
That's awful.

656
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:07,167
You have to know what to kill.

657
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,733
Is this why all your students

658
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,067
Say your knowledge of history is...

659
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,167
so amazing?

660
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,267
No, that's mostly based on study.

661
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:18,534
Remember, it's one man,
one place at a time,

662
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,867
My solitary viewpoint

663
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,568
Of a world I knew almost nothing about.

664
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:24,834
Well, let's talk about

665
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,867
What you say you
do know about--

666
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,600
Historical times.

667
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,733
Don't encourage him.

668
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,967
Edith.

669
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,800
Next few thousand years, it got warmer.

670
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,234
A few thousand
years--

671
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,934
See, now, I know you're guessing.

672
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:40,234
You can't get there from here, Art.

673
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,600
Well then, pray, continue.

674
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:45,600
We hunted
reindeer, mammoths--

675
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,633
Bison, horses,

676
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,134
The game retreated northward

677
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,367
As the climate changed,

678
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,468
You got the idea of growing food

679
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:54,301
Rather than gathering it,

680
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,434
Raising animals rather
than hunting them.

681
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:58,067
Am--Am I getting
warm, here?

682
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,633
I bet I am.

683
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:02,101
Lakeside living becomes commonplace,

684
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,733
Fishing,
fowling-- Come on!

685
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,000
John, this is out of any textbook.

686
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,067
Even yours.

687
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,934
You got most of it right.

688
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,501
Eventually I headed to the east.

689
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,967
I'd grown curious about the world.

690
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,334
I'd gotten the hang of going it alone,

691
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,334
Learning how to fit in when I wanted to.

692
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,234
East.

693
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:24,134
Towards the rising sun?

694
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,900
Yes. I thought it might be warmer there.

695
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,034
That's when I saw an ocean.

696
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,067
The mediterranean, probably.

697
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,534
It was around the
beginning of the bronze age,

698
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,733
So I followed the trade
routes from the east,

699
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,000
Copper, tin,

700
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,101
Learning languages as I went.

701
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:47,267
Everywhere, creation myths,

702
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:50,867
New gods, so many, so different.

703
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,733
I finally realized that it was...

704
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,334
probably all hogwash,

705
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:57,934
So I was sumerian for 2,000 years,

706
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:00,234
Then finally babylonian under hammurabi.

707
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:01,800
Great man.

708
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,367
And I sailed as a phoenician for a time.

709
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:07,568
See, moving on had been
easier as a Hunter-Gatherer...

710
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,667
difficult when villages emerged,

711
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,101
Tougher still in city states
where authority was centralized.

712
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:16,934
Strangers were suspect.

713
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:20,600
It seemed as though I
was always moving on.

714
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,633
I learned some
new tricks--

715
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,234
Even faked my death a couple of times.

716
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,568
I continued east

717
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,401
To india,

718
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:34,867
Luckily at the time of the Buddha.

719
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,067
Luckily.

720
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,534
Most extraordinary man I've ever known.

721
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:42,733
He taught me things

722
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,767
I'd never thought about before.

723
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:47,367
You studied... with the Buddha?

724
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,834
Until he died.

725
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:53,101
He knew there was something
different about me.

726
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,900
I never told him.

727
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,967
This is fascinating.

728
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,267
I almost wish it were true.

729
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, if it was true,
why are you telling us?

730
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,733
I mean, we might leave here today,

731
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,101
Go out there, tell everybody.

732
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,834
It would vanish in disbelief.

733
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,501
A story that goes around the room.

734
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,600
No credibility.

735
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Even if I could make you believe me,

736
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,468
In a month, you wouldn't.

737
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,000
Some of you would call me a psychopath,

738
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,468
Others would be angry
at a pointless joke.

739
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,234
Some of us are angry now.

740
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,501
This--This
was a bad idea.

741
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,234
Uh, I love you all, and I do not want

742
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:32,568
To put you through anything.

743
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:33,934
Then why are you doing it?

744
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,234
'Cause I wanted
to say goodbye--

745
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,234
As yourself.

746
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,767
I think you've done that,

747
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:39,867
Whoever that self is.

748
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,134
Easy, Edith.

749
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:42,800
We're just grading his homework.

750
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,600
I see what's going on. You're
playing the good cop, Dan.

751
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,967
That's fine. Just enjoy it.

752
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,633
All right, I think this
whole thing is just a crock!

753
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,401
I should leave, but I'm gonna stay.

754
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:54,101
You know why? 'Cause I wanna
see what this is all about.

755
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,667
So do I. What is this all about?

756
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,767
Let's ask Dr. Freud,
who's just arrived.

757
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,167
Hey, will! Will!

758
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,101
Art. Hey.

759
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,501
John!

760
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm glad I caught you.

761
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,733
Someone mentioned
that you were leaving--

762
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,867
Called you, told you that I've lost it.

763
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,633
Glad you're here. Things are
going in unexpected directions.

764
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:13,900
Yes, so I hear.

765
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,201
Hi.

766
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:16,667
Are you hungry?

767
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,367
Uh, thank you, no.

768
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,534
Whiskey? Johnny walker green.

769
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,534
Oh, yes.

770
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:25,934
( Closes door )

771
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:28,468
You look very familiar,
my dear. Linda murphy.

772
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:31,134
I'm in your tuesday
psych 1 class, Dr. Gruber.

773
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:33,700
Ah, well, this lesson may be something

774
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,800
I could not have imagined.

775
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,167
I regret being so
obvious about this, John,

776
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:44,434
But these people are all
very concerned for you.

777
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:47,101
Yes, I'm cutting out paper dinosaurs.

778
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:50,267
I really wish I'd been
here from the beginning.

779
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,334
Me too.

780
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,367
Let me just say something right now.

781
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,700
There's absolutely no
way in the whole world

782
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,501
For John to prove this story to us,

783
00:30:58,501 --> 00:31:01,468
Just like there's no way
for us to disprove it.

784
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,700
No matter how outrageous we think it is,

785
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,967
No matter how highly trained
some of us think we are,

786
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:09,201
There's absolutely
no way to disprove it.

787
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,667
Our friend is either a
caveman, a liar, or a nut.

788
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,167
So while we're thinking about that,

789
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,834
Why don't we just go with it?

790
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,334
I mean, hell, who knows,

791
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,434
He might jolt us into believing him,

792
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:23,367
Or we might jolt him back to reality.

793
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,600
Believing? Whose reality?

794
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,367
So... you're a caveman.

795
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,700
Yes. Uh...

796
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,167
<i>uh, I was a Cro-magnon, I think.</i>

797
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,934
You don't know if
you're a caveman or not?

798
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:37,234
No, I'm sure about that.

799
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,401
A Cro-magnon, then.

800
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,534
When did you first realize this?

801
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:42,733
When the Cro-magnon
was first identified,

802
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,834
When anthropology gave them a name,

803
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,367
I had mine.

804
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,800
Well, please continue.

805
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,934
I'm sure you must have more to say.

806
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:51,667
Would you like me to lie on the couch?

807
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:54,267
( Laughs ) as you wish.

808
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:58,767
As a physician, I'm curious.

809
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,101
In this enormous lifetime you describe,

810
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:03,934
Have you ever been ill?

811
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:05,767
Sure, as much as anyone.

812
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,367
Seriously ill?

813
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,867
Sometimes.

814
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,834
Of what? Do you know?

815
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,434
In prehistory, I can't tell you.

816
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:13,967
Maybe pneumonia once or twice.

817
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,900
Last few hundred years,

818
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,000
I've gotten over typhoid, yellow fever,

819
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,234
Smallpox...I survived the black plague.

820
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,568
Bubonic?

821
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,967
Oh, that's terrible.

822
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,700
More so than history describes.

823
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,234
And smallpox-- But
you're not scarred.

824
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,468
I don't scar.

825
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:34,633
No, John, that is not possible.

826
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,201
Please, let's take John's story

827
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:38,967
At face value and explore
it from that perspective.

828
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:42,434
If he doesn't scar, it's
no stranger than the rest.

829
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,900
John, would you please stop by my lab,

830
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,767
Suffer a few tests from

831
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,600
Your friendly neighborhood biologist.

832
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,967
I'm leery of labs.

833
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,201
Afraid I might go in and
stay for a thousand years

834
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,600
While cigarette smoking
men try to figure me out.

835
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,468
You don't think that I would betray you?

836
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,967
Walls have ears.

837
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,468
Medical tests might be a
way of proving what you say.

838
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:01,767
I don't wanna prove it.

839
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:02,867
So you're telling us this,

840
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,000
The yarn of the century,

841
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,900
And you don't care if
we believe it or not?

842
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,468
I guess I shouldn't
have expected you to.

843
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,101
You're not as crazy as you think I am.

844
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,101
Amen.

845
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,800
I've always liked you.

846
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,034
Why, thank you, dear.

847
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,434
Now that's changing.

848
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:15,967
Surely you don't believe this nonsense.

849
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,000
I think we should remain
courteous to someone

850
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,667
Who we've known and trusted, Edith.

851
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,067
Here you sit--You
can't break his story.

852
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,067
All you can do is thumb your nose at it.

853
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,000
Is that what you're doing, John?

854
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,101
Are you laughing at us inside?

855
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,434
I wish you didn't feel that way.

856
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:33,800
What you're saying--
It offends common sense.

857
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,633
So does relativity,
quantum mechanics--

858
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:37,334
That's the way nature works.

859
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:41,733
But your story doesn't fit
into nature as we know it.

860
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,468
But we know so little, Dan.

861
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:45,700
We know so little.

862
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,000
How many of you know

863
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,267
Five geniuses in your field

864
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,568
That you disagree with...

865
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,167
one you would like to strangle?

866
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,367
Strangle them all.

867
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,000
It's bad enough we have to listen

868
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,101
To Harry's idiotic jokes.

869
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,501
Thank you very much, Edith.

870
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,900
Maybe when I'm 110, I'll
be as smart as you are.

871
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,367
If you lived as long as John did,

872
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,501
You still wouldn't grow up.

873
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,700
Come on, guys. Take it easy.

874
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,167
How often do we get to meet someone

875
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:10,633
Who says he's a stone age man?

876
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,900
Well, once is enough.

877
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,334
Edith.

878
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,534
All right. A guy
with your mind--

879
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,534
You'd have studied a great deal.

880
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:20,967
I have ten degrees,
including all of yours...

881
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,401
except yours, will.

882
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:25,568
That makes me feel a trifle lilliputian.

883
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:27,967
That's over the span of 170 years.

884
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,201
I got my biology degree
at oxford in 1840,

885
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,934
So I'm a little behind the times.

886
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:34,267
The same in
other areas--

887
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,034
I can't keep up with the
new stuff that comes along.

888
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,034
No one can.

889
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,334
Not even in their specialty.

890
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:40,934
So much for the myth

891
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,667
Of the super-wise,
all-knowing immortal.

892
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,600
I see your point, John.

893
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,267
No matter how long a man lives,

894
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,401
He can't be in advance of his times.

895
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:51,434
He can't know more than
the best of the race knows,

896
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:54,401
If that--I mean, when the
world learned it was round,

897
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,767
You learned it.

898
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,067
It took some time.

899
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,434
News traveled slowly

900
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:00,334
Before communications were fancy.

901
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,000
There were social obstacles,

902
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,201
Preconceptions, screams from the church.

903
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,401
Ten doctorates.

904
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,267
That's impressive,
John. Did you teach them?

905
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,667
Some.

906
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,301
You might have all done the same.

907
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:16,434
Living 14,000 years
didn't make me a genius.

908
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:17,767
I just had time.

909
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,434
Time.

910
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,434
We can't see it, we can't hear it,

911
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:25,134
We can't weigh it, we can't
measure it in a laboratory.

912
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:27,434
It's a subjective sense of becoming

913
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:31,900
What we are instead of what
we were a nanosecond ago,

914
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,334
Becoming what we will
be in another nanosecond.

915
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,301
The hopis see time as a landscape,

916
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,367
Existing before and behind us,

917
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,301
And we move-- We
move through it,

918
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,134
Slice by slice.

919
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,434
Clocks measure time.

920
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,834
No, they measure themselves.

921
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:48,234
The objective referent
of clock is another clock.

922
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,633
How very interesting. What
has it got to do with John?

923
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,700
Oh, he--He
might be a man

924
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,733
Who lives outside of time as we know it.

925
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:02,767
Yes, uh, well.

926
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,301
People do go around armed these days.

927
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:09,000
If I shot you, John--
You're immortal?

928
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Would you survive this?

929
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,767
I never said I was immortal, just old.

930
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,000
I might die.

931
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,434
And then you could wonder

932
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:18,800
The rest of your incarcerated
life what you shot.

933
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:23,267
Well, uh, may I?

934
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,934
( Sighs )

935
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,633
Preferable to a gun.

936
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,900
Will, that was a bit much.

937
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,000
Ooh. Books.

938
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,167
Doctorates.

939
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:38,568
Yes, you have grown and changed.

940
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:41,600
But there is always innate nature.

941
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,201
Wouldn't you be more comfortable

942
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,834
Squatting in the backyard?

943
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,234
Sometimes I do, will.

944
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,834
Look up at the stars.

945
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:48,900
Wonder.

946
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,301
And what did primitive man make of them?

947
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,267
A great mystery.

948
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,700
There were gods up there then.

949
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,201
Shamans who knew about them told us.

950
00:36:58,201 --> 00:36:59,468
They still do.

951
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,934
Have you ever wished it would end?

952
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:06,568
No.

953
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:08,967
Fourteen thousand years.

954
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:12,101
Injuries, illness, disasters.

955
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:14,267
You've survived them all.

956
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,301
You're a very lucky man.

957
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,633
( Knocks )

958
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:22,834
Come in.

959
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,900
John Oldman?

960
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,301
Yes.

961
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:30,201
Charity now. We're here
to pick up the furniture.

962
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,034
It's all yours.

963
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,301
Here, take this chair.

964
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,267
I'm gonna go drink in the corner.

965
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,834
You're, uh... you're donating it?

966
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:41,201
Everything?

967
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:42,267
I'll get more.

968
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:43,800
Do you always travel this light?

969
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,934
It's the only way to move.

970
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,534
Oh, you--

971
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,101
You've talked a good deal

972
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,334
About your extraordinary
amount of living.

973
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,534
What do you think of dying, John?

974
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:58,167
Do you fear death?

975
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,501
Who wouldn't?

976
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,967
How did primitive man regard death?

977
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,767
Well, we had the practical concept.

978
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,434
You know, we stopped,

979
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:07,667
Fell down, didn't get up,

980
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,434
Started to smell bad, come apart.

981
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:12,067
Injuries we
could understand--

982
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:14,633
If someone's insides
were all over the ground.

983
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,000
Infections...

984
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,468
they were, uh, mysterious.

985
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,067
Aging...

986
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,633
the biggest mystery of all.

987
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,667
You realized you were different.

988
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:29,733
<i>Longer to realize how I was different,</i>

989
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,600
To find a way to synthesize

990
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,568
My experience into a view of myself.

991
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:36,633
At first, I thought everybody had

992
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,434
Something wrong with them.

993
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:42,034
They got old and they
died, animals, too...

994
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,134
but not me.

995
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:45,700
( Coughs pointedly )

996
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,900
Oh, forgive me, my dear.

997
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,600
You live simply.

998
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,101
I've owned castles, but why leave a lot

999
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:54,401
If you're always leaving?

1000
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,667
I have money.

1001
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,401
What, you get into
at&t at 50 cents, John?

1002
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,367
As one grows older,

1003
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:07,700
The days, weeks, months
go by more quickly.

1004
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,600
What does a day or a year

1005
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,867
Or a century mean to you?

1006
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:16,000
The birth-death cycle?

1007
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,767
Turbulence.

1008
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,267
I meet someone,

1009
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:22,101
Learn their name, say
a word, they're gone.

1010
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:26,534
Others come like waves. Rise, fall.

1011
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,501
Ripples in a wheat
field, blown by the wind.

1012
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,234
Do you ever get tired of it all?

1013
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:34,700
I get bored now and then.

1014
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,967
They keep making the same
stupid mistakes over and over.

1015
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:38,900
Hey.

1016
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,234
Then you see yourself

1017
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:43,434
As separate from the rest of humanity.

1018
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,234
I didn't mean it that way.

1019
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:48,700
But of course...

1020
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:50,900
I am.

1021
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,267
( Chuckles )

1022
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:55,134
Are you comfortable
knowing that you have lived

1023
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:59,000
While everyone you knew--
Everyone you knew, John!--

1024
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,201
Has died?

1025
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,967
I've regretted losing people...

1026
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,034
often.

1027
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,234
Have you ever felt
guilt about that--

1028
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,834
Something akin to survivor's guilt?

1029
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,967
In the strict psychological sense?

1030
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,334
I suppose I have.

1031
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,468
Yeah.

1032
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:16,034
But what can I do about it?

1033
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:19,534
Indeed.

1034
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:22,101
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1035
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:23,101
Gentlemen,
I'm--

1036
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,034
I'm gonna keep the couch.

1037
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:26,034
Thanks.

1038
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,234
Ladies? Will? Oh, no...

1039
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:30,867
you've got a heart condition.
Don't grump about it.

1040
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,667
Hey, how about changing
the subject, will?

1041
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,501
Enough with the--
With the dying.

1042
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:38,201
But this is the flip
side of his coin, Harry.

1043
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,034
I'm very curious to know his feelings.

1044
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:43,934
Would you prefer I asked
him about his father?

1045
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,367
I thought you always started with

1046
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:46,767
"Tell me about your mother."

1047
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,800
Yes, but prehistory was
strongly patriarchal.

1048
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,534
Surely you remember your father.

1049
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:56,067
I seem to remember a figure,

1050
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:59,000
Perhaps an older brother,
a social father, maybe.

1051
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,733
Well, no matter.

1052
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:03,101
I can scarcely remember mine.

1053
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,167
Do you feel a vacancy

1054
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,067
In your life about that, John,

1055
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,201
Something you wish could be filled

1056
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:14,101
By a face, a voice, an image?

1057
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,000
Not at this late date.

1058
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,301
There must be someone--
Probably many--

1059
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,034
That you valued intensely.

1060
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,468
Loved.

1061
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:27,000
You saw them
age and die--

1062
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,468
A friend, a colleague, a wife.

1063
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:33,767
Certainly you've had wives and children?

1064
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,201
I'd move on.

1065
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,034
I had to move on.

1066
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:39,733
Making him history's biggest bigamist.

1067
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:40,834
( Chuckles softly )

1068
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,501
Have you ever in your life thought

1069
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,134
"It should have been me"?

1070
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:48,501
Maybe.

1071
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, Art has told me

1072
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
That some of your early fellows

1073
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,334
Feared you were stealing their lives.

1074
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:57,167
Have you thought that perhaps you were?

1075
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,667
Perhaps you are!

1076
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:01,867
There have always been
legends of such a thing,

1077
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,967
A creature not quite human

1078
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:08,034
Taking not the blood,
but the life force itself?

1079
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:09,367
My god, will.

1080
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,834
Unconsciously, perhaps,

1081
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:15,834
By some biological or psychic mechanism

1082
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,867
That we can only guess at.

1083
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,867
I'm not saying you would do
such a thing deliberately.

1084
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:23,934
I'm not saying that you
would even know how to...

1085
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:25,267
would you?

1086
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,700
But would such a thing be fair?

1087
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,401
So you believe me now?

1088
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:34,767
I'm only exploring what you have said.

1089
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:38,667
Whether I believe it or
not is of no importance.

1090
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,067
We will die...

1091
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,267
you will live.

1092
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:44,401
Will you come to my funeral, John?

1093
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:45,700
Hey, will...

1094
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,934
you've gone too far.

1095
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:49,101
John didn't ask to be what he is.

1096
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:52,267
And we did not ask to hear about it.

1097
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,834
But if it were true,

1098
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:56,900
Is there one among us
who would not feel envy,

1099
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,401
Even perhaps a touch of hatred?

1100
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,834
You told us of yourself, John.

1101
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:05,067
Can you imagine how we feel?

1102
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,850
I never thought of that.

1103
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,450
Since you may not die,

1104
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,250
While we most assuredly will...

1105
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,417
there must be a reason for that, no?

1106
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,284
Perhaps you are an expert.

1107
00:43:17,684 --> 00:43:20,217
Uh, that's it, Mr.
Oldman. Have a good one.

1108
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:21,950
Thank you. You too.

1109
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,783
Or are you a vampire, John?

1110
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,550
Even an unknowing one.

1111
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,317
Do you stand alive and tall

1112
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:35,450
In a graveyard that you helped to fill?

1113
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,983
That's going too far.

1114
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:39,883
Bored, perhaps lonely,
because your heart

1115
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,517
Cannot keep its treasures.

1116
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:43,950
Is that what you're doing?

1117
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,317
Have you led a wrongful life?

1118
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,417
Well, then, perhaps...

1119
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,350
it is time to die.

1120
00:43:55,117 --> 00:43:56,384
Wait a minute, now.

1121
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,384
Look, I don't know what John is doing,

1122
00:43:58,384 --> 00:44:00,850
But I sure as hell don't
like what you're doing.

1123
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,284
Give me that gun or I'm
gonna break your goddamn arm.

1124
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:06,617
You sound like our football coach, Dan.

1125
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:08,584
What do you think, John?

1126
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,584
A shot to the arm?

1127
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,484
Perhaps we could watch it heal.

1128
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,284
A bullet in
the head--

1129
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:17,816
What exactly will happen?

1130
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:25,983
I have papers to correct.

1131
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,883
As much as I dislike that job,

1132
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:31,417
It'll be preferable to this.

1133
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,083
I leave you with it.

1134
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,751
Jesus Christ.

1135
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:41,684
What the hell was that all about?

1136
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:43,017
Where'd he get a gun?

1137
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:44,517
He had you on the ropes, John.

1138
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:46,183
Are you really so damn smart?

1139
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,550
It's not like will.

1140
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,250
Mary passed away yesterday.

1141
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:55,017
Who?

1142
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:57,417
His wife.

1143
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:00,617
She had, uh, pancreatic cancer.

1144
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:03,584
Will!

1145
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:06,950
I didn't know about mary.

1146
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,350
I'm sorry. I can see how
this might have hit you.

1147
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,284
Please, permit me to
be infantile by myself.

1148
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:16,617
Will, please.

1149
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,417
( Starts car )

1150
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,617
What the hell were you thinking, Art?

1151
00:45:34,617 --> 00:45:36,916
Oh, come on. Something had to be done.

1152
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,450
I have to say I agree.

1153
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,717
And he's our friend.

1154
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:41,950
Whatever else on earth is going on,

1155
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,017
He's our friend!

1156
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,117
You sure about that?

1157
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,717
Why are you being so hard on him?

1158
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:48,417
One of my favorite
people has disappeared.

1159
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:52,250
Can you get alzheimer's at 35?

1160
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,117
Maybe I'm trying to wake him up.

1161
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:58,751
Maybe I'm too sad to cry.

1162
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,017
What I said about myself hurt him.

1163
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,450
He struck
back expertly--

1164
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,450
That stuff about stealing life forces?

1165
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,983
I've always wondered about the reasons.

1166
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,651
Well, we still have an
afternoon to kill, right?

1167
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,550
Charades?

1168
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:31,983
No. John?

1169
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:34,651
I have a charade, and
it is just for you.

1170
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:35,717
Sandy, come here.

1171
00:46:35,717 --> 00:46:37,517
Come on, come on, come on.

1172
00:46:37,517 --> 00:46:39,017
Okay, this one's for you.

1173
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:41,017
Ready?

1174
00:46:41,017 --> 00:46:43,217
( Grunts like ape )

1175
00:46:45,183 --> 00:46:47,517
( Wolf whistles )

1176
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:48,651
( Grunting )

1177
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:53,783
Ooh!

1178
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,017
Uhn.

1179
00:46:55,017 --> 00:46:56,983
My first wedding?

1180
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,250
There you go.

1181
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,684
There you go!

1182
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:02,384
Very good, and I bet at least one of us

1183
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:03,584
Is your direct descendent.

1184
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:05,350
And I didn't even send a christmas card.

1185
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,717
Christmas card? What
about a birthday card?

1186
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:10,017
And don't even get me
started on the candles...

1187
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:12,017
with the blowing and the ( huffs )

1188
00:47:12,017 --> 00:47:13,916
For years with the blowing.

1189
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,950
Yeah, all right. I tried.

1190
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,217
Well, uh, call me underdeveloped,

1191
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,584
But I'd like to hear more.

1192
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:27,017
Me too.

1193
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:28,450
More.

1194
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,816
You double-damn swear
this isn't some cockamamie

1195
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:33,017
Science fiction story or...

1196
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,384
you're pulling on us?

1197
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,916
Next question.

1198
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:38,384
You--You--You
realize

1199
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:39,584
This is an invitation

1200
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:41,751
To men in white suits with happy pills.

1201
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:42,816
Think about it--

1202
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:44,651
A mechanism allowing survival

1203
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:46,050
For thousands of years?

1204
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,317
Run out of room even faster.

1205
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:50,584
Then we'd have to go to mars as a colony

1206
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:52,484
As we expanded, as we'd have to.

1207
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:54,450
I'd like that.

1208
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,417
On a planet of another star.

1209
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:58,317
I envy you.

1210
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:00,684
Did you have a pet dinosaur?

1211
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:03,050
They were a little bit before my time.

1212
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,317
At least something is.

1213
00:48:04,317 --> 00:48:07,384
No doubt you could give us
a thousand details, John,

1214
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,484
Corroborating your story,

1215
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,950
From the magdalene to the Buddha to now.

1216
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,150
Ten thousand,

1217
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,751
And you could stay out of the books.

1218
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:16,250
Oh, it's getting chilly.

1219
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,450
Here, come over here. Join me.

1220
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,450
That, uh, raises an
interesting question, John.

1221
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,983
Could there be others like you

1222
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:28,183
Who escaped the aging
process as you have?

1223
00:48:28,183 --> 00:48:29,250
Representing something terrific

1224
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,916
We don't even know about biology.

1225
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:31,950
We're learning all the time.

1226
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,417
Yeah, but how would he know?

1227
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:36,450
He doesn't wear an I.D. Badge
saying "yabba dabba doo."

1228
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,250
There was a man in the 1600s.

1229
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,717
Where were you in 1292 a.D.?

1230
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:44,317
Where were you a year ago on this date?

1231
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:49,751
Anyway, it was the
1600s, and I met a man,

1232
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:52,484
And I had a hunch that he was...

1233
00:48:52,484 --> 00:48:54,450
like me, so I told him.

1234
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,217
Ah. See, you said this was a first.

1235
00:48:58,217 --> 00:48:59,250
I forgot.

1236
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,117
A crack in your story, John?

1237
00:49:01,117 --> 00:49:02,584
A touch of senility.

1238
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:05,150
Anyway, he said yes,

1239
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,150
But from another time, another place.

1240
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,717
We talked for two days.

1241
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:10,684
It was all pretty convincing,

1242
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:12,983
But we couldn't be sure.

1243
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,117
We each confirmed what the other said,

1244
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,517
But how do we know if the confirmation

1245
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:19,117
Was genuine or an echo?

1246
00:49:19,117 --> 00:49:21,083
I knew I was kosher,

1247
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,983
But I thought, "maybe
he's playing a game on me."

1248
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:28,417
You know, a scholar
of all we spoke about.

1249
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,450
He said he was inclined
with the same reservation.

1250
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,717
Now, that's interesting.

1251
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:34,883
Just as we can never be sure,

1252
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:36,384
Even if we
wanted to--

1253
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:38,017
I mean, if we were sure,

1254
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,717
You couldn't be sure of that.

1255
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:41,816
We parted, agreeing
to keep in touch--

1256
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:43,284
Of course,
we didn't--

1257
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,751
And 200 years later I thought I saw him

1258
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:48,017
In a train station in brussels.

1259
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:49,584
Lost him in the crowd.

1260
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:51,783
Oh, what a shame.

1261
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,850
I--I mean, if
it were true.

1262
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,384
Okay, here's one for you.

1263
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:57,684
What do you do in your spare time?

1264
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:58,850
( Laughs )

1265
00:49:58,850 --> 00:49:59,983
Every 50 years or so,

1266
00:49:59,983 --> 00:50:01,883
When I wanna get away from the rush,

1267
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,916
I go down to a primitive
tribe in new guinea

1268
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:06,651
Where I'm worshipped as an immortal god,

1269
00:50:06,651 --> 00:50:09,050
And they have a huge statue of me.

1270
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,284
It's a big party.

1271
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:12,350
Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures of it,

1272
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,217
But I've already packed
them up. I'm sorry.

1273
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:17,950
I won't make the obvious nasty
crack about more unwashed cavemen.

1274
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,350
Actually, bathing was the style

1275
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,217
Until the middle ages
when the church told us

1276
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:24,083
It was sinful to wash away god's dirt,

1277
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,350
So people were sewn

1278
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,850
Into their underwear in october

1279
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,651
And they popped out in april.

1280
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,450
You said you just happened.

1281
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,517
I don't believe that.

1282
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:34,150
If your story's true,

1283
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,816
Why did god allow you to happen?

1284
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:39,983
That makes an interesting point.

1285
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:41,684
Are you religious, John?

1286
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:44,217
I don't follow a known religion. No.

1287
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:45,317
Ever.

1288
00:50:45,317 --> 00:50:47,617
Long time ago I did,

1289
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:49,883
Like most people.

1290
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,684
Some just never get over it.

1291
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:53,083
Do you believe in god?

1292
00:50:54,183 --> 00:50:55,983
As laplace said,

1293
00:50:55,983 --> 00:50:58,617
"I have no need of that hypothesis."

1294
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:00,183
He may be around, though.

1295
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,783
He's everywhere. We just can't see him.

1296
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,484
Pfft. If this was the best I could do,

1297
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:06,916
I'd be hiding, too.

1298
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,550
And creation...

1299
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,883
it's here--I'm not so
sure it was created.

1300
00:51:10,883 --> 00:51:12,250
What then?

1301
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,816
Maybe it's just accumulated,
fields affecting fields.

1302
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,484
What about the source
of the field energies?

1303
00:51:18,484 --> 00:51:20,484
Wouldn't that imply a prime mover?

1304
00:51:20,484 --> 00:51:22,617
I'd wonder about the
source of the prime mover,

1305
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:25,816
Infinite regress, but that
doesn't imply anything to me.

1306
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,617
Back to the mystery.

1307
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,684
It's a very old question,

1308
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:33,550
But there's no answer
except in religious terms.

1309
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,317
If you have faith, it's answered.

1310
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:39,751
Did you ever meet any person
from our religious history?

1311
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,816
A biblical figure?

1312
00:51:41,816 --> 00:51:43,150
In a way.

1313
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,883
Who?

1314
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:46,384
We should skip this one.

1315
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:48,083
No, no, no skipping. Come on.

1316
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,150
Next question.

1317
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,550
No, come on!

1318
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,117
( Clamoring )

1319
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:53,417
Come on, spit it out!

1320
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:55,083
Good lord! You were one of them!

1321
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,717
This is going in a direction
that I--I didn't expect.

1322
00:51:58,717 --> 00:52:01,517
I hoped it wouldn't--
We...call it a night.

1323
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:05,117
Come on! You were someone
in religious history?

1324
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:06,384
Yes.

1325
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:07,916
In the bible?

1326
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,916
Yes.

1327
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:09,983
Someone we know?

1328
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:12,017
How could we not know
someone in the bible?

1329
00:52:12,017 --> 00:52:13,217
I mean somebody important.

1330
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,916
You may think you know him,

1331
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,484
But it's mostly myth.

1332
00:52:16,484 --> 00:52:19,950
The entire bible is
mostly myth and allegory

1333
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,183
With maybe some basis
in historical events.

1334
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:27,517
You were part of that history?

1335
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:28,617
Yes.

1336
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,017
Moses.

1337
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:34,850
Moses was based on misis, a syrian myth,

1338
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,417
And there are
earlier versions--

1339
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:38,550
All found floating on water,

1340
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,983
The staff that changed to a snake,

1341
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,617
Waters that were parted so followers

1342
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:45,450
Could be led to freedom

1343
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,717
And even receive laws

1344
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:48,284
On stone or wooden tablets.

1345
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:51,217
One of the apostles.

1346
00:52:51,217 --> 00:52:53,883
They weren't really apostles.

1347
00:52:53,883 --> 00:52:56,050
They didn't do any real teaching.

1348
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,350
Peter the fisherman learned
a little more about fishing.

1349
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,384
How do you know that?

1350
00:53:03,816 --> 00:53:06,783
The mythical overlay is so enormous...

1351
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:10,250
and not good.

1352
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:16,450
The truth is so, so simple.

1353
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,150
The new testament in 100
words or less. You ready?

1354
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,584
I don't think I wanna hear this.

1355
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:23,317
Harry, will you take me home?

1356
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:25,183
No, not right now. I
do want to hear this.

1357
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:27,550
Sit down, Edith. You
act like you believe him.

1358
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,983
It's sacrilege.

1359
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:30,217
How can it be sacrilege?

1360
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:31,350
He hasn't said anything yet.

1361
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,050
The new new testament is sacrilege.

1362
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,584
There are a dozen new new testaments,

1363
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:39,717
From hebrew to greek
to latin to tyndale,

1364
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,550
All the way to king james,

1365
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,916
All revisionist,

1366
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,183
And all called revealed truth.

1367
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:48,384
I mean a new new testament in 100 words.

1368
00:53:48,384 --> 00:53:50,684
I can give you the ten
commandments in ten words.

1369
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,284
Don't. Don't, don't, don't,

1370
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:54,083
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

1371
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,717
( Laughs ) Don't.

1372
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:58,783
The commandments are just modern
updates of more ancient laws.

1373
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:00,651
Hammurabi's code.

1374
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:03,150
That's right, they
weren't the first, right?

1375
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,117
Edith, I was raised on the torah...

1376
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,617
my wife, on the koran.

1377
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,384
My oldest son is an atheist.

1378
00:54:09,384 --> 00:54:10,883
My youngest is a scientologist.

1379
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:12,916
My daughter is studying hinduism.

1380
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:17,150
I imagine that there is room there
for a holy war in my living room,

1381
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,350
But we practice live and let live.

1382
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,117
Why don't you sit down.

1383
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:32,150
What is your preferred
version of the bible?

1384
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,651
The King James, of course.

1385
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:36,117
It's the most modern, the
work of great scholars.

1386
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:37,617
Modern is good.

1387
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,651
All right, John, hit
us with the short form.

1388
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,717
Guy met the Buddha, liked what he heard,

1389
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,450
Thought about
it for a while--

1390
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,350
Say 500 years, while he returned

1391
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,617
To the Mediterranean,

1392
00:54:50,617 --> 00:54:53,317
Became an etruscan.

1393
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:54,950
Seeped into the roman empire.

1394
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,751
He didn't like
what they became--

1395
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,017
A giant killing machine.

1396
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:00,751
He went to the near east thinking,

1397
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:04,017
"Why not pass the Buddha's
teachings on in a modern form."

1398
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:06,284
So he tried.

1399
00:55:06,284 --> 00:55:08,450
One dissident against rome?

1400
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:09,651
Rome won.

1401
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,050
The rest is history.

1402
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,517
Well, sort of. Lot of
fairy tales mixed in.

1403
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,350
I knew it.

1404
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,651
He's saying he was Christ.

1405
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,217
Oh, no. That's the medal

1406
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:24,550
They pinned on Jesus
to fulfill prophecy.

1407
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,783
The crucifixion.

1408
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:28,783
He blocked the pain
as he had learned to do

1409
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,183
In tibet and india.

1410
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:32,584
He also learned to
slow his body processes

1411
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:35,183
Down to the point where
they were undetectable.

1412
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:36,617
They thought he was dead.

1413
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:38,017
So his followers pulled him

1414
00:55:38,017 --> 00:55:40,350
From the cross, placed him in a cave...

1415
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,983
his body normalized as
he had trained it to...

1416
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,783
he attempted to go away undetected,

1417
00:55:46,783 --> 00:55:49,183
But some devotees were standing watch.

1418
00:55:50,617 --> 00:55:53,017
Tried to explain.

1419
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,517
They were ecstatic.

1420
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:58,017
Thus, I was resurrected,

1421
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:59,816
And I ascended to central europe

1422
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:02,050
To get away as far as possible.

1423
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,517
You don't mean a word of this, John.

1424
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:06,517
My god, why are you doing this?

1425
00:56:06,517 --> 00:56:08,083
Let me see your wrists.

1426
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,584
I don't scar.

1427
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:11,250
Besides, they tied me...

1428
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,550
but nails and blood make
better religious Art.

1429
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,584
( Laughs ) all the
speculations about Jesus.

1430
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:19,384
He was black, he was asian,

1431
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:22,350
He was a blue-eyed
Aryan with a golden beard

1432
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,350
And hair straight out
of vidal sassoon's,

1433
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,517
He was a benevolent alien,
he never existed at all.

1434
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,684
Now he's a caveman.

1435
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:32,783
The Christ figure goes all
the way back to Krishna--

1436
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:33,850
Hercules, of course.

1437
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:34,916
Hercules?

1438
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:37,050
Born of a virgin, Alcmene.

1439
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,250
A god for a father, Zeus.

1440
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,916
The only begotten.

1441
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,517
<i>The savior--
The greek? Soter.</i>

1442
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:47,684
The good shepherd, the prince of peace,

1443
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:50,217
Bringing gentle persuasion
and divine wisdom.

1444
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:53,617
He died, joined his father on olympus

1445
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,850
A thousand years before gethsemane.

1446
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,717
How can you compare pagan
mythology to the true word?

1447
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:02,317
Pretty damn closely, I'd say.

1448
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:04,816
The early Christian leaders,

1449
00:57:04,816 --> 00:57:06,751
They threw away hebrew manuscripts

1450
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:09,651
And borrowed from pagan
sources all over the place.

1451
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:12,317
Do you realize how...

1452
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:14,584
inconsiderately you're
treating my feelings?

1453
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:18,083
About as inconsiderately
as we're treating John's.

1454
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,384
Well, he doesn't
believe what he's saying!

1455
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:22,950
Do you believe literally
everything in the bible, Edith?

1456
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,117
Yes!

1457
00:57:24,117 --> 00:57:25,517
Before you say it,

1458
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:28,183
I know it's undergone a lot of changes,

1459
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:30,684
But god has spoken through man

1460
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:32,751
To make his word clearer.

1461
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:35,183
He couldn't get it right the first time?

1462
00:57:35,183 --> 00:57:38,217
We're imperfect! He had to
work to make us understand.

1463
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:41,584
<i>He couldn't get us right
the first time, Edith?</i>

1464
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:44,384
Taken alone, the
philosophical teachings of Jesus

1465
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:46,550
Are buddhism with
a hebrew accent--

1466
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,317
Kindness, tolerance, brotherhood, love,

1467
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:52,050
A ruthless realism acknowledging

1468
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,284
That life is as it is here
on earth, here and now.

1469
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:57,850
The kingdom of god, meaning goodness,

1470
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:01,517
Is right here, where it should be.

1471
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:03,651
"I am what I am becoming."

1472
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,217
That's what the Buddha brought in.

1473
00:58:05,217 --> 00:58:06,651
And that's what I taught.

1474
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,617
But a talking snake
make a lady eat an apple,

1475
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:10,783
So we're screwed.

1476
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:12,350
Heaven and hell were peddled

1477
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,384
So priests could rule
through seduction and terror,

1478
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:18,850
Save our souls that we never
lost in the first place.

1479
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,517
I threw a clean pass...

1480
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:22,617
they ran it out of the ballpark.

1481
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:25,384
This is blasphemy.

1482
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,684
It's horrible! Who else were you?

1483
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:31,017
Solomon, elvis, jack the ripper?

1484
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:32,816
It's been said that Buddha and Jesus

1485
00:58:32,816 --> 00:58:34,717
Would laugh or cry if they'd known

1486
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:36,183
What was done in their name.

1487
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:38,017
And if there is a creator,

1488
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:39,783
He'd probably feel the same way.

1489
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:43,717
I see ceremony, ritual, processions,

1490
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:46,050
Genuflecting, moaning, intoning,

1491
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,850
Venerating cookies and wine,

1492
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,651
And I think...

1493
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:52,250
it's not what I had in mind.

1494
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,384
But that's vatican flapdoodle.

1495
00:58:53,384 --> 00:58:55,916
It doesn't have a thing to do with god.

1496
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,317
As you said, John,
everywhere, religions...

1497
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:02,183
from exalting life to
purging joy as a sin.

1498
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:04,850
Rome does it as grand opera.

1499
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:07,916
A simple path to goodness needs

1500
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,883
A supernatural roadmap.

1501
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,050
Supernatural...

1502
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,717
a stupid word, I mean...

1503
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,617
anything that happens,
happens within nature,

1504
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:18,250
Whether we believe in it or not.

1505
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,850
Like a 14,000-year-old
caveman.

1506
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,183
( Car approaching )

1507
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:31,816
I--I--I drove
for a while,

1508
00:59:31,816 --> 00:59:33,983
And then I sat for a while.

1509
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:35,417
I'm so ashamed.

1510
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,117
( Shivering ) and I'm freezing.

1511
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:38,417
Well, come inside.

1512
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:40,550
I still don't believe you, of course.

1513
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,617
You need help.

1514
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:42,651
Everybody needs help.

1515
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,717
Yes, well, some more than others.

1516
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:00,916
From the Buddha to the cross,

1517
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:05,584
I have always imagined
both as entirely mythic--

1518
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:08,017
But I would like to hear more.

1519
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:10,717
May I lie on the couch for a moment?

1520
01:00:10,717 --> 01:00:13,350
I'm not as young as I used to be.

1521
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,117
Ohh!

1522
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,217
( Laughs )

1523
01:00:19,217 --> 01:00:23,284
So, you were Jesus.

1524
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:26,384
Well, perhaps somebody had to
be, for better or for worse.

1525
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:28,150
The jury is still out.

1526
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,183
When did you begin to
believe you were Jesus?

1527
01:00:31,183 --> 01:00:34,284
When did you begin to believe
you were a psychiatrist?

1528
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:37,417
Since I graduated harvard medical school

1529
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:40,117
And finished my residency,
I've had that feeling.

1530
01:00:40,117 --> 01:00:42,983
Oh, I sometimes dream about it.

1531
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:44,651
Have you acted upon this belief?

1532
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:47,017
I had a private practice for a while,

1533
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:48,584
And then I taught.

1534
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:49,983
Nothing unusual--

1535
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:53,250
Oh, until one day, I met a caveman

1536
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,350
Who thought he was Jesus.

1537
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:58,350
Do you find that unusual?

1538
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,783
Very. I would stake my reputation

1539
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:03,217
He as sane as I am,

1540
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:06,150
So why does he persist in such a story?

1541
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,317
There must be a reason, though.

1542
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:10,217
Unless I imagined it all?

1543
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,517
Is that possible?

1544
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:13,350
I think you're as sane as he is.

1545
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,717
Oh, god, I--

1546
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:16,816
( Laughs ) no.

1547
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,284
Did you ever find it
prudent to worship yourself

1548
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:23,083
Rather than be thought a heretic?

1549
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,350
That would be something.

1550
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,883
Other times, christianity
was considered heresy.

1551
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,684
I had to pretend other faiths.

1552
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:32,751
And what does Jesus have
to say to those present

1553
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:35,150
Who find it difficult to believe in him?

1554
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,816
Believe in what he tried to teach,

1555
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:39,783
Without rigmarole.

1556
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:42,417
Piety is not what the
lessons bring to people.

1557
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:45,150
It's the mistake they
bring to the lessons.

1558
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,284
Well, it's getting to be night.

1559
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:58,950
I still have stuff to carry

1560
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,317
And a long drive.

1561
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,883
I'll help.

1562
01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:06,484
John, do you have a
destination in mind?

1563
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,217
Never mind.

1564
01:02:09,217 --> 01:02:10,617
I won't ask.

1565
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:12,684
Thank you.

1566
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,916
Anyone mentally ill can imagine

1567
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:25,883
A fantastic background--
Even an entire life--

1568
01:02:25,883 --> 01:02:28,217
And sincerely believe it.

1569
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:30,816
The man who thinks he is napoleon

1570
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:32,717
Does believe it.

1571
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:35,717
His true identity has taken a backseat

1572
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:38,550
To his delusion and the need for it.

1573
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,816
If that's the case with John,

1574
01:02:40,816 --> 01:02:42,550
There is a grave disorder.

1575
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,017
Organized brilliantly.

1576
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:47,117
He's got an answer for everything.

1577
01:02:47,117 --> 01:02:49,751
It might involve
rejection of his father,

1578
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:51,717
Of his entire early past,

1579
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:53,083
Replaced by this fantasy.

1580
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,183
He says he can't remember his father.

1581
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:56,217
Precisely why?

1582
01:02:56,217 --> 01:02:57,783
You said he was sane.

1583
01:02:57,783 --> 01:02:59,083
Did I?

1584
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:02,983
Do you think that perhaps our caveman

1585
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:04,783
Has a monkey on his back?

1586
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:06,417
Drugs?

1587
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:07,916
No, no, no, no.

1588
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,317
I've done a lot of consulting
work with narcotics.

1589
01:03:10,317 --> 01:03:12,350
I've seen people
tripping, strung out--

1590
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,517
Whatever's up with John, it isn't that.

1591
01:03:14,517 --> 01:03:16,651
I've looked
for signs--None.

1592
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:18,250
Could cavemen really talk?

1593
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,651
We think that language
came into existence

1594
01:03:20,651 --> 01:03:21,950
60,000 years ago.

1595
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,983
The structure of stone age culture

1596
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:26,250
Is evidence of the
ability to communicate--

1597
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,684
Verbally.

1598
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:29,350
( Wolf whistles; clicks )

1599
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,517
Oh, shut up.

1600
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,883
Maybe it'd be easier if I were.

1601
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:44,050
Crazy?

1602
01:03:45,317 --> 01:03:46,883
No.

1603
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:49,883
( Coyote howls )

1604
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:02,783
That is fascinating, isn't it,

1605
01:04:02,783 --> 01:04:05,916
A brave attempt to teach
buddhism in the west.

1606
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,783
It's no wonder he failed.

1607
01:04:07,783 --> 01:04:09,317
We're not ready for it.

1608
01:04:09,317 --> 01:04:11,751
You're talking
as if you believed him.

1609
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:13,850
Well, it is possible, isn't it?

1610
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,050
I mean, anything is possible.

1611
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,916
Look, we have two simple choices.

1612
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:20,384
We can get all bent out of shape

1613
01:04:20,384 --> 01:04:22,751
Intellectualizing or
bench-pressing logic,

1614
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:25,384
Or we can simply relax and enjoy it.

1615
01:04:25,384 --> 01:04:27,217
I can listen critically,

1616
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:30,584
But I don't have to make
up my mind about anything.

1617
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:32,083
But you think you do?

1618
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,816
Well, unfortunately, there's
no authorities on prehistory,

1619
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:36,617
So we couldn't stop him there.

1620
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:38,417
There are experts on the bible.

1621
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,050
Dream on.

1622
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,384
Yeah, thus the lost years of Jesus.

1623
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:45,083
He didn't exist until John put on a hat.

1624
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:49,117
I don't believe in angels and the
nativity and the star in the east,

1625
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:52,250
But there are stories about
the childhood of Jesus.

1626
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,684
History hates a vacuum.

1627
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:57,250
Improvisation, some of it very sincere,

1628
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,417
Fills the gaps.

1629
01:04:58,417 --> 01:04:59,783
It would have been easy

1630
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:02,717
To falsify a
past back then--

1631
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:06,083
A few words, credulity--
Time would do the rest.

1632
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:08,250
Now you're talking as
if you believed him.

1633
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,450
Well, look at the
popular myths surrounding

1634
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,083
The Kennedy assassination
in a few short years--

1635
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:16,550
You had, uh,
conspiracy, Mafia, CIA--

1636
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,117
That's a mystique that'll never go away.

1637
01:05:19,117 --> 01:05:22,950
It's always been a small step
from a fallen leader to a god.

1638
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,816
I don't think anybody
will deify kennedy.

1639
01:05:25,816 --> 01:05:27,783
We're more sophisticated than that.

1640
01:05:27,783 --> 01:05:29,317
We are?

1641
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:30,950
We are.

1642
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,183
Well, you're finally fulfilling

1643
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,083
One prophecy about the millennium, John.

1644
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,350
What's that?

1645
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,916
Here you are again.

1646
01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:54,484
You like the fire, John.

1647
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:57,983
Everywhere I've lived,
I've had a fireplace.

1648
01:05:57,983 --> 01:06:00,484
Childhood fixation, I guess.

1649
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,183
Helps me to feel secure.

1650
01:06:05,584 --> 01:06:07,651
There are predators out there.

1651
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,751
One thing I didn't pack...

1652
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,717
I thought I might need it.

1653
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:19,183
( Plays beethoven's 7th symphony )

1654
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,250
<i>Wouldn't sacre du printemps
be more appropriate?</i>

1655
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,317
What?

1656
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,050
You've got...

1657
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,217
four men of science
completely baffled, my friend.

1658
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:34,816
We--We don't know
what to make of you.

1659
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:37,584
Did you know voltaire
was the first to suggest

1660
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:41,017
That the universe was created
by a gigantic explosion?

1661
01:06:41,017 --> 01:06:43,350
I think paul would agree.

1662
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,816
And then goethe was the first to suggest

1663
01:06:45,816 --> 01:06:49,684
That spiral nebulae were
swirling masses of stars.

1664
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:51,883
We now call them galaxies.

1665
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,617
It's kind of funny how
often new concepts of science

1666
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:57,517
Find their first tentative
forms of expression in the arts.

1667
01:06:57,517 --> 01:07:02,484
So did beethoven do physics on the side?

1668
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:05,783
He spent most of his
time lying on the floor

1669
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:07,517
In front of his legless piano

1670
01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:10,250
Surrounded by orange
peels and apple cores.

1671
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:15,217
Now we're on the floor
listening to beethoven.

1672
01:07:16,484 --> 01:07:18,050
Full circle.

1673
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,350
Did you have, um...

1674
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,183
any religious beliefs,

1675
01:07:23,183 --> 01:07:25,816
Or did you give it much thought?

1676
01:07:25,816 --> 01:07:27,684
You can't get there with thought.

1677
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:29,684
You have faith?

1678
01:07:29,684 --> 01:07:31,017
In a lot of things.

1679
01:07:31,017 --> 01:07:34,083
Do you have faith in
the future of the race?

1680
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,083
I've seen species come and go.

1681
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,150
Depends on their balance
with the environment.

1682
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,550
We've made a mess of it.

1683
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,183
There's still time,

1684
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:44,950
If we use it well.

1685
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,651
Christianity has been a worldwide belief

1686
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,384
For 2,000 years.

1687
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:51,584
How long did the egyptians worship isis

1688
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:53,250
Or the sumerians ishtar?

1689
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,883
In india, sacred cows wandered freely

1690
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:57,751
As reincarnated souls.

1691
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,517
In a thousand years,
they'll be barbecued

1692
01:07:59,517 --> 01:08:01,117
And their souls will be in squirrels.

1693
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:02,484
You weren't Jesus!

1694
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:05,717
Oh, Edith.

1695
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:11,284
( Clears throat ) if
it rains... it won't.

1696
01:08:11,284 --> 01:08:12,484
How do you know that?

1697
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,017
I don't smell it.

1698
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:18,450
Were you...

1699
01:08:19,717 --> 01:08:21,950
I guess... a medicine man?

1700
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,250
I was a shaman a few times.

1701
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,584
I revealed some truths
to eat a little better.

1702
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:30,651
You think that's all
religion is about...

1703
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:33,250
selling hope and survival?

1704
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,651
The old testament sells fear and guilt.

1705
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:38,350
The new testament is
a good code of ethics,

1706
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,816
Put into my mouth by
poets and philosophers

1707
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,983
That are much smarter than I am.

1708
01:08:42,983 --> 01:08:44,983
The message is never practiced.

1709
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,783
Fairy tales build churches.

1710
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,117
What about the name "Jesus"?

1711
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:53,150
Did you pull that out of a hat?

1712
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:55,117
I called myself John.

1713
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:57,850
I almost always do.

1714
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,916
As tales of the resurrection spread,

1715
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:02,684
<i>The name was confused
with the hebrew "yochanan,"</i>

1716
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,550
Meaning "god is gracious."

1717
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,350
My stay on earth was seen

1718
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,017
As divine proof of immortality.

1719
01:09:09,017 --> 01:09:13,651
That led to "god is salvation"

1720
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:15,183
<i>Or hebrew "yahshua,"</i>

1721
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:18,350
Which in translation
became my proper name,

1722
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:21,250
<i>Changing to late greek, "iesous,"</i>

1723
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,584
<i>Then to late latin, "iesus,"</i>

1724
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:26,217
And finally medieval latin, "Jesus,"

1725
01:09:26,217 --> 01:09:28,950
And it was a wonder
to watch it all happen.

1726
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:32,150
Then you didn't claim
to be the son of god?

1727
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,450
Began as a schoolhouse
and ended as a temple.

1728
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:39,017
I said I had a master that
was greater than myself.

1729
01:09:39,017 --> 01:09:41,017
I never said he was my father.

1730
01:09:41,017 --> 01:09:43,017
I wanted to teach what I learned.

1731
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:45,117
I never claimed to be king of the jews,

1732
01:09:45,117 --> 01:09:48,250
I never walked on water,
I never raised the dead.

1733
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,584
I never spoke of divine
except in the sense

1734
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:53,751
Of human goodness on earth.

1735
01:09:57,284 --> 01:10:00,883
No wise men came from the
east to worship at a manger.

1736
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:03,050
I did do a little healing

1737
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,883
With some eastern medicine I'd learned.

1738
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:08,783
That's it.

1739
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,783
The three wise men began as a myth

1740
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,350
About the birth of the Buddha.

1741
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:25,050
John, I should be home,
uh, kissing my wife.

1742
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,417
We're all here, trapped by your story...

1743
01:10:30,883 --> 01:10:36,651
hoping for a...revolution? I don't know.

1744
01:10:39,983 --> 01:10:42,117
Are there any, uh...

1745
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:43,883
more revelations for us?

1746
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,250
It's just like old times.

1747
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:00,850
You weren't Jesus.

1748
01:11:03,751 --> 01:11:06,050
Quote the sermon on the mount.

1749
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,384
Which one?

1750
01:11:07,384 --> 01:11:10,584
Darby, King James,
New American Standard?

1751
01:11:10,584 --> 01:11:12,484
Do you know them all?

1752
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:15,651
No one knows the one, not even me.

1753
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,017
I...

1754
01:11:17,017 --> 01:11:19,317
I did some teaching on a hill one day.

1755
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,384
Not that many people stayed.

1756
01:11:21,384 --> 01:11:22,550
But you...

1757
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,584
biblical Jesus said,

1758
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:27,816
"Who do you think I am?"

1759
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,450
He gave them a choice.

1760
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:32,350
I'm giving you one.

1761
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:36,684
Were you?

1762
01:11:38,684 --> 01:11:41,317
If I said no, could you ever be sure?

1763
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:51,350
( Sobs )

1764
01:11:58,484 --> 01:12:00,417
Turn that off.

1765
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:01,384
Please.

1766
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:06,584
This has gone far enough.

1767
01:12:06,584 --> 01:12:08,517
It's gone much too far.

1768
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:10,850
These people are very upset.

1769
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,617
I don't believe you're mad,

1770
01:12:13,617 --> 01:12:15,916
But what you're saying is not true.

1771
01:12:17,017 --> 01:12:19,850
That leaves only one explanation.

1772
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:23,117
The time has come when you must admit

1773
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:24,317
This is a hoax...

1774
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:27,317
a lie.

1775
01:12:27,317 --> 01:12:30,983
Isn't that true, John?

1776
01:12:30,983 --> 01:12:33,751
If you don't drop
this now-- If you can--

1777
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:35,317
I'll be convinced

1778
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:38,183
That you need a great deal of attention.

1779
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:41,217
I can have you committed
for observation.

1780
01:12:41,217 --> 01:12:42,517
You know that.

1781
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:44,517
I ask
you now--

1782
01:12:44,517 --> 01:12:46,751
I demand
it--

1783
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:49,816
That you tell these people the truth.

1784
01:12:49,816 --> 01:12:53,584
Give them closure.

1785
01:12:53,584 --> 01:12:56,350
It's time, John.

1786
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,550
Please.

1787
01:13:11,217 --> 01:13:13,983
End of the line. Everybody off.

1788
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,250
What?!

1789
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,083
It was a story.

1790
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,517
It was all a story.

1791
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:24,517
( Sobs )

1792
01:13:24,517 --> 01:13:25,450
Good god!

1793
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,550
Another fairy tale?

1794
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,816
All of it?
But what--

1795
01:13:30,816 --> 01:13:32,217
What in the name of heaven...

1796
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:34,450
John, you had us wondering
whether you were sane or not,

1797
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,083
And it's just a story!

1798
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:39,384
Where'd you come off with such
a half-baked, asinine idea?

1799
01:13:39,384 --> 01:13:41,183
At least you're relieved I'm not a nut.

1800
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,684
I'd prefer you were!

1801
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,484
You gave me the idea.

1802
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:45,783
All of you.

1803
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:47,250
Come again?

1804
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,816
Edith saw my fake Van Gogh.

1805
01:13:48,816 --> 01:13:50,384
You could have just told me.

1806
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,684
You commented that I never age.

1807
01:13:51,684 --> 01:13:53,484
You gave me the book on early man.

1808
01:13:53,484 --> 01:13:55,117
Dan, you spotted the burin

1809
01:13:55,117 --> 01:13:56,783
And you said, "if stones could speak."

1810
01:13:56,783 --> 01:13:58,450
I knew it.

1811
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,916
I got the notion, I ran it past you

1812
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,484
To check your reactions,
and I took it too far.

1813
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:04,883
Too far?

1814
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:06,384
Check my reaction.

1815
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:08,950
You asked if I was a figure
from religious history,

1816
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,517
If there were others like me,

1817
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:11,950
If I'd created future identities.

1818
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,050
We were chasing our
tails around the maypole,

1819
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,250
Enjoying the mystery,
the analytical stretch.

1820
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,183
You were playing my game!

1821
01:14:20,183 --> 01:14:21,783
I was playing yours.

1822
01:14:21,783 --> 01:14:24,384
Oh, man, you know, you
had us going, right?

1823
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:25,651
You were good, man.

1824
01:14:25,651 --> 01:14:27,150
You know those chinese boxes,

1825
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:30,217
One inside the other inside
the other inside the other--

1826
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:33,284
I feel like I'm in the last box.

1827
01:14:33,284 --> 01:14:35,584
You son of a...

1828
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:36,651
bitch!

1829
01:14:36,651 --> 01:14:38,183
How could you do this to us?

1830
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:40,284
I was worried about you.

1831
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:42,717
I know, I was tempted
to cop out many times,

1832
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:44,983
But I couldn't resist
seeing whether or not

1833
01:14:44,983 --> 01:14:46,751
You could refute what I was saying.

1834
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:48,250
I had the
perfect audience--

1835
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,584
Anthropologist, archaeologist,

1836
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:52,684
Christian literalist...

1837
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:54,883
a psychologist.

1838
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:56,983
Okay, I've had enough of this.

1839
01:14:56,983 --> 01:14:59,050
I'm outta here. You
wanna come? Let's go.

1840
01:15:00,183 --> 01:15:01,450
So, John.

1841
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,950
Are you gonna write the story?

1842
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,651
If I do, I'll send you copies.

1843
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:06,284
Don't bother with mine, okay?

1844
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:09,150
You are absolutely certifiable.

1845
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,883
I don't know you!

1846
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,584
It was nice seeing
you again, Dr. Oldman.

1847
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,816
Your name's a pun, isn't it?

1848
01:15:18,816 --> 01:15:19,816
Old man?

1849
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,284
Did that help you with your story?

1850
01:15:24,284 --> 01:15:25,916
Linda!

1851
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,617
Bye.

1852
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,017
Well, Art was half right.

1853
01:15:34,017 --> 01:15:35,517
( Laughs )

1854
01:15:35,517 --> 01:15:37,050
Which half?

1855
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:42,850
Well, at least I don't
have to throw away half

1856
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,651
Of what I know about biology.

1857
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:46,783
Which half?

1858
01:15:46,783 --> 01:15:47,883
( Chuckles )

1859
01:15:47,883 --> 01:15:49,983
It's a beautiful idea,

1860
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:53,850
So rich, so full of possibilities.

1861
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,217
Perhaps you should write
a paper on it, doctor.

1862
01:15:57,217 --> 01:15:58,983
Maybe I will.

1863
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:01,150
I'll interview you in the rubber room

1864
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:02,684
For further details.

1865
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:04,717
You may still need help, my friend.

1866
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,717
My ass.

1867
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:21,916
I thought it sounded pretty good.

1868
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:24,083
They believe you because they have to.

1869
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,050
But the one thing that I know about you

1870
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,651
Is that you would never use people

1871
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:29,050
Or abuse their goodwill and intelligence

1872
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,117
Like they think you've
just done to them.

1873
01:16:31,117 --> 01:16:32,284
Psych 101?

1874
01:16:32,284 --> 01:16:34,883
No, it's woman,
one-on-one.

1875
01:16:34,883 --> 01:16:37,284
So you're a pretty fast liar, Mr. Ugg,

1876
01:16:37,284 --> 01:16:40,450
But I wanna know--
What's your real name?

1877
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:45,384
Believe it or not, the
sound was always John.

1878
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:47,651
Why'd you cave to Gruber?

1879
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:49,217
What happened was enough.

1880
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:50,617
Just--Just
needed to stop.

1881
01:16:50,617 --> 01:16:52,783
I shouldn't have expected it to work.

1882
01:16:54,183 --> 01:16:55,983
Fourteen thousand years old.

1883
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:58,083
I bet that's a lot of women.

1884
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,083
Are we counting?

1885
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,450
Maybe.

1886
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,484
Well, I'm taking Edith home.

1887
01:17:05,484 --> 01:17:06,417
Sandy?

1888
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:09,350
I'm gonna stay.

1889
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:16,083
Are you sorry for some
of those things you said?

1890
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,651
I'm sorry I said them.

1891
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:20,150
Well.

1892
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,617
Like a good Christian,

1893
01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:24,816
I...oh, John.

1894
01:17:24,816 --> 01:17:26,617
Oh! Well.

1895
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:30,083
You did a terrible thing,

1896
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:32,517
But we're all so
thankful you're all right.

1897
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:35,584
Even Art--He just hates
things he can't understand.

1898
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,417
You're a sadist, John,

1899
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,550
But I admit I got a kick out of

1900
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,284
Chasing my tail around your maypole...

1901
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:43,484
even if that is all I caught.

1902
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:44,684
Good luck to you.

1903
01:17:44,684 --> 01:17:46,250
Wish you the best. Thank you.

1904
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,284
Ready?

1905
01:17:56,317 --> 01:17:58,183
- Later on.
- Okay, good night.

1906
01:18:01,017 --> 01:18:01,950
Mm-hmm.

1907
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,617
Mmm.

1908
01:18:06,617 --> 01:18:09,550
I don't know, man.

1909
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:11,617
Something about this...

1910
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:13,484
something about you, John.

1911
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:16,050
The more I think about it,

1912
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,916
The more I'm no longer
in that chinese box.

1913
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,050
( Inhaling deeply )

1914
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:22,684
I sense...space.

1915
01:18:22,684 --> 01:18:27,584
A kinda latitude of what
we happily call reality,

1916
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:30,651
In which, as everybody keeps saying...

1917
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:33,384
anything's possible.

1918
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:35,450
Yes. No, no. No, no.

1919
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:37,484
No--No
more words.

1920
01:18:37,484 --> 01:18:39,250
I'm gonna go home,

1921
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,050
<i>And I'm gonna watch star trek</i>

1922
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,584
For a dose of sanity.

1923
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:45,250
Good luck to you, man,

1924
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,850
Wherever this may lead you.

1925
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:50,083
You drop me a line sometime.

1926
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,916
Let me know how you're making out.

1927
01:18:53,484 --> 01:18:54,450
I will.

1928
01:18:56,751 --> 01:18:57,983
Mm. Mwah.

1929
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,850
So, John Oldman.

1930
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:11,417
What other pun names have you used?

1931
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:12,751
Lots.

1932
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:17,350
John Paley for John Paleolithic,

1933
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,783
John Savage--

1934
01:19:19,783 --> 01:19:21,883
Got really crazy about 60 years ago.

1935
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,751
When I was teaching at harvard,

1936
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:26,617
I was John Thomas Partee.

1937
01:19:26,617 --> 01:19:29,150
John T. Partee--
Boston tea party--

1938
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,484
I get it.

1939
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:31,550
Yeah, I know.

1940
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,816
Wait, wait, wait.

1941
01:19:32,816 --> 01:19:35,183
Boston?

1942
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:37,050
60 years ago?

1943
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,450
J-John Partee?

1944
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,916
You did not teach chemistry!
I do not believe you!

1945
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,751
Your mother's name was Nola.

1946
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:52,983
No. Yeah.

1947
01:19:52,983 --> 01:19:55,083
No.

1948
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,584
Yes, Nola.

1949
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,217
( Crying ) my mother!

1950
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:02,183
I reject this!

1951
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,783
My--My--My
dog's name.

1952
01:20:06,883 --> 01:20:08,783
We had him before I was born.

1953
01:20:08,783 --> 01:20:09,850
Woofie.

1954
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,183
Woof, woof, woofie...

1955
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:18,317
Gruber. She remarried?

1956
01:20:18,317 --> 01:20:20,584
She said you abandoned us.

1957
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,350
Sorry, I had to move on.

1958
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,083
You know that. I left enough.

1959
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,017
I left enough. I'm cold.

1960
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:29,417
Chilly willy, always cold.

1961
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,484
Never could stand the cold.

1962
01:20:31,484 --> 01:20:35,183
( Sobs ) wait, you--
You had a beard.

1963
01:20:35,183 --> 01:20:36,850
Yeah, you used to tug on it

1964
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:38,417
To see if it was real.

1965
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,983
Agh! Will!

1966
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:40,916
God.

1967
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,816
911, now!

1968
01:20:43,816 --> 01:20:45,217
( Gruber gasps )

1969
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:47,550
Come on, Will.

1970
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,751
Will.

1971
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:49,684
Come on, buddy.

1972
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:56,117
( Siren blaring )

1973
01:21:21,883 --> 01:21:24,183
You'll stay in touch, Dr. Oldman.

1974
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:26,050
In case there are any questions.

1975
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,217
I'll be back for the funeral.

1976
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,250
Miss.

1977
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:41,684
You never saw a grown child die.

1978
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:44,083
No.

1979
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:29,450
Chantelle duncan: *I've seen rivers rise *

1980
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:33,684
* seen mountains fall *

1981
01:23:33,684 --> 01:23:39,017
* seen endless vistas coming to an end *

1982
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:44,417
* I've seen stars collide *

1983
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:48,450
* heard oceans roar *

1984
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:54,983
* I know what it means
to lose your only friend *

1985
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:00,584
* nothing lasts forever *

1986
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:04,017
* that's what I've always heard *

1987
01:24:04,017 --> 01:24:06,983
* all things good must esnd *

1988
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:10,584
* you know it's true *

1989
01:24:11,717 --> 01:24:15,250
* nothing lasts forever *

1990
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:18,850
* but maybe some things do *

1991
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:26,317
* forever is the way I feel for you *

1992
01:24:26,317 --> 01:24:32,417
* forever is the way I feel for you *

1993
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:48,450
* I've seen men take *

1994
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,550
* the world into their hands *

1995
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:57,717
* and change it, mold it,
to their point of view *

1996
01:24:59,883 --> 01:25:02,883
* I've felt the earth shake *

1997
01:25:02,883 --> 01:25:07,050
* seen men take a stand *

1998
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:13,550
* and fight when it's
the one thing left to do *

1999
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:19,083
* nothing lasts forever *

2000
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:23,017
* that's what I've always heard *

2001
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,517
* all things good must end *

2002
01:25:25,517 --> 01:25:29,083
* you know it's true *

2003
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:33,617
* nothing lasts forever *

2004
01:25:33,617 --> 01:25:37,517
* but maybe some things do *

2005
01:25:37,517 --> 01:25:44,883
* forever is the way I feel for you *

2006
01:25:44,883 --> 01:25:51,083
* forever is the way I feel for you *

2007
01:25:57,217 --> 01:26:00,484
* nothing lasts forever *

2008
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:04,484
* that's what I've always heard *

2009
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:07,083
* all things good must end *

2010
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:11,783
* you know it's true *

2011
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:15,450
* nothing lasts forever *

2012
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:18,983

2015
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:41,183
* forever is the way I feel for you *
